 yield rate per unit of land/ water. Apart 

from that, for attaining higher levels of productio
n, considerable importance is accorded to 
crop-specific strategies. New strategies are being 
evolved to break yield barriers, to utilize 
inputs more efficiently and diversify to more susta
inable and higher value crops. 
 In the above backdrop, the performance of the agric
ultural sector during 2011-12 and 
2012-13 is fully reviewed using the data available.
 For 2013-14, the prospects of the 
agricultural sector are based on the data available
, forecasts and projections made and target 
set.  
 4.1. Agriculture Prospects Œ 2013-14 
 The overall crop prospects in the State during 2013
 Œ 14 are encouraging.  During the 
current year the onset of the South-West Monsoon wa
s in time. The temporal spread of 
rainfall during this monsoon was by and large favou
rable for raising crops.  It was ‚excess™ in 
June and August and ‚normal™ in September. The spat
ial spread indicated that it was ‚normal™ 
in 17 districts, ‚excess™ in 7 districts, ‚deficit™
 in 6 districts and ‚scanty™ in 2 districts.  Thus,
 the 
spatial spread benefited 73.0 percent of the total 
geographical area of the State spread over 
24 districts.  The total quantum of rainfall receiv
ed  from this  season at 325.4 mm  was  rated  
as ‚normal™. The temporal and spatial 

spread of rainfall during this monsoon was 

also helpful in recharging the groundwater 

considerably. Apart from this, the monsoon 

brought copious inflows into the State™s 

surface flow sources and built up adequate  

storages. In tune with the requirements of 

the farmers, the release of water from the 

main reservoir viz., Mettur dam since 2
rd
 August 2013 was regulated in a systematic 

manner with adequate quantity. The 

release of water from other important 
reservoirs was also in accordance with the requirem
ents of the farmers. 
 The irrigation scenario in the State during the cur
rent year 2013 Œ 14 has turned out to 
be encouraging.  This resulted in an increase in th
e area under irrigated cropping in the 
State. Besides, the Government made fool-proof arra
ngements for the timely and adequate 
supply of all necessary inputs through Agricultural
 Extension Centres. The Co-operative 
Societies were geared up to provide adequate crop l
oans to the eligible farmers. The State 
Government provided uninterrupted 12 hours three ph
ase power supply to the delta districts 
and 8 hours for non-delta districts for encouraging
 the farmers to take up agricultural activities 
with sub-surface water.   All these efforts of the 
State were aimed to motivate the farmers and 
to redouble their efforts to take up agricultural a
ctivities with more vigour during the current 
year.  
 The intervention of North-East Monsoon during the y
ear was in time.  However, the 
rainfall received was in deficit during the entire 
season.  It was (-) 29.6 percent in October 
2013, (-) 33.7 percent in November 2013 and (-) 39.
3 percent in December 2013.  During this 
monsoon period, as against the normal level of 440.
4 mm, the actual rainfall received in the 
State was 294.3 mm (-33.2%).  The spatial spread al
so was uneven.  The uneven distribution 
of rainfall over time and space during the North-Ea
st Monsoon would have some adverse 
impact on the standing crops and crops grown mainly
 under rainfed conditions. The carry-
over storages in the surface flow sources that came
 from the South-West Monsoon were 
utilized.  As a result, it is hoped to bring in mor
e area under cultivation, area irrigated and to

reduce current fallows to a considerable extent as 
compared to the level of 2012-13. All these 
factors would be conducive for the agricultural sec
tor to recover from the impact of drought 
witnessed in the previous year 2012-13 during 2013-
14. Ultimately, the overall cropping 
scenario in the State for the year is turning out t
o be encouraging.   
 With the favourable interplay of the above factors,
 the State forecasts to attain higher 
crop production during 2013-14 as compared to 2012-
13. This would be possible with an 
increase in the coverage of area under cropping as 
well as the yield of crops.  As per Second 
Advance Estimates for 2013-14 the expected rate of 
increase in the production of foodgrains 
would be from 56.05 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 to 85.46
 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 (53.0%), 
groundnut from 7.85 lakh tonnes to 9.90 lakh tonnes
 (26.0%), cotton from 2.55 lakh bales to 
3.18 lakh bales (25.0%) and sugarcane from 340.14 l
akh tonnes to 375.46 lakh tonnes  
(10.0%).  Ultimately the contribution of the agricu
ltural sector to Gross State Domestic 
Product (GSDP) is anticipated to register a higher 
order growth 8.22 per cent during the 
current year 2013-14 as against the 5.0 percent con
templated during the 12
th
 Five Year Plan.     
 4.2. Agricultural Performance during 2011 Œ 12 and 
2012 Œ 13: 
  The agricultural sector witnessed a severe drought
 impacting the area, yield and 
production of all important crops in the State duri
ng 2012 Œ 13.  This brought about a steep 
fall of 13.04 percent in the Gross State 

Domestic Product (GSDP) of the 

agricultural sub sector between 2011 Œ 

12 and 2012 - 13.  As a result, the 

relative share of the sub sector in the 

primary sector declined from 83.0 

percent in 2011 Œ 12 to 80.0 percent in 

2012 Œ 13 and in overall State™s GSDP 

from 7.4 percent to 6.2 percent.  
 The ‚deficit rainfall™ during the pre-monsoon perio
d viz., January 2012 Œ May 2012 (-) 
39.9 percent, South-West Monsoon period June 2012  
Œ September 2012  (-)24 percent and 
the  ‚uneven temporal spread™ of the northeast mons
oon (October +42.0%, November (-) 
54.0% & December (-) 62.0%), coupled with non-relea
se of Cauvery water for agricultural 
purposes by Karnataka State and depletion of ground
water level had its adverse impact on 
‚surface™ and ‚sub-surface™ water level during the 
year 2012 Œ 13. As against the total storage 
capacity of 198.384 tmcft in 15 major irrigation re
servoirs in the State, the live storage by the 
end of December 2012 was only 31.28 tmcft (16%). Th
e storage in these reservoirs in 2011 
was comfortably high at 68.0 percent and the live s
torage was 134.70 tmcft.  The average

average fall in the ground water level in the State
 between January 2012 and 2013 was from 
5.37 meters to 7.34 meters i.e., by 1.97 meters.   
 As against the normal rainfall of 921.0 mm, the tot
al quantum of rainfall received 
during the year 2012 Œ13 was 743.1 mm.  Eventhough 
it was rated as normal, the continuous 
long dry spell in the State, had its adverse impact
 on ‚surface™ and ‚sub-surface™ water caused 
‚drought™ affecting agricultural activities in the 
State. 
 The adverse effect of the 
drought got reflected in the 

reduction in gross area sown by 

12.7 percent, gross area irrigated 

by 15.0 percent and increase in 

fallows by 17.3 percent in 2012 Œ 13 

as compared to 2011 Œ 12.  The 

cropping intensity declined from

percent in 2012-13 and that of 

irrigation intensity from 119.0 percent to 113.2 pe
rcent.   
  
Based on the report of the High Level Committee and
 taking into account the 
prevailing drought situation, in February 2013, the
 Government declared 31 districts of Tamil 
Nadu except Chennai as drought-affected and sanctio
ned various relief measures separately 
for delta and non-delta districts. Apart from this,
 a Drought Memorandum seeking assistance 
of Rs.19, 665.13 crore was sent to Government of In
dia.  
 4. 3. Land Holdings:       
            
A combination of factors such as
 i
ncreasing 
industrialization, urbanization, housing activities
 and 
infrastructure development triggered the conversion
 of 
agricultural land into non agricultural uses. This 
has 
resulted in a decline of the area under cultivation
. The 
scope for expansion of the area available for culti
vation is 
also very limited.  The pattern of land ownership i
mposes 
limitations on the models that can be adopted for 

agricultural development.  As per the latest Agricu
ltural 
Census 2010-11, marginal and small holdings   of
 less 
than 2 hectares accounted for 92.0 percent of the t
otal 
holdings and 61.0 percent of the total operated are
a. They in turn are unsuitable for 
conventional technology and machinery use to boost 
agricultural production. This led to a 
process of marginalization of small and marginal fa
rmers and casualization of agricultural 
labourers. To derive the best results and to empowe
r marginal and small farmers, they may 
be motivated to form farmers™ groups so as to get a
ll the technical inputs in time and to 
ensure judicious use of various scarce resources.
  The total number of operational land holdings in th
e State declined from 81.93 lakh in 
2005 Œ 06 to 81.18 lakh in 2010 Œ 11 (0.9%).  This 
implies that the farmers may have given 
up their cultivation because of the lucrative price
 offered for land on account of fast 
urbanization. This was more prevalent in the vicini
ty of urban areas.  Among the districts, the 
number of land holdings was the lowest in The Nilgi
ris (64,369) and the highest in

Villuppuram (6,15,543). Tamil Nadu™s share of the t
otal all-India operational holdings as per 
the 2010-11 Agricultural Census at 137.8 million wa
s 5.9 percent.  With continuous 
fragmentation of small (1 to 2 hectares), medium (2
 to 10 hectares) and large (10 hectares 
and above) holdings, the number of marginal holding
s increased in the State from 62.28 lakh 
to 62.66 lakh (0.6%) between the two Censuses. The 
share of marginal and small holdings in 
total holdings in the State rose from 91.1 percent 
to 91.7 percent. It was 85 percent at the all-
India level. 
 The total area operated also 
declined from 68.24 lakh hectares in 

2005 Œ 06 to 64.88 lakh hectares in 

2010 Œ 11 (4.9%).  Of the total area 

operated in all India at 159.2 million 

hectares, Tamil Nadu accounted for 4 

percent. The average size of land holding in the St
ate further reduced from 0.83 hectare in 
2005-06 to 0.80 hectare in 2010-11.  The average si
ze of land holding at the all-India level 
was comparatively higher at 1.16 hectare.    
 Among the districts as per the Agriculture Census 2
010-11, the average size of land 
holding was in the range of 0.22 hectare in Kanniya
kumari to 2.00 hectare in Tiruppur.  Out of 
31 districts, in as many as 18 districts the averag
e size of holdings was below the State™s 
average (0.80 hectare). The small size of land hold
ings inhibits investment in productivity-
enhancing measures and makes many agricultural hold
ings sub-optimal.   
 The average size of large holdings at 20.58 hectare
s in Tamil Nadu  was  higher than 
the all-India average size 17.38 hectares.  In Tami
l Nadu, the average size of marginal

holdings at 0.37 hectare, small holdings at 1.39 he
ctare and medium holdings at 3.37 hectare 
were somewhat smaller than that of all-India at 0.3
8 hectare, 1.42 hectare and 3.60 hectare 
respectively.    
 Of the total land holdings in State, institutional 
holdings accounted for a meagre share 
of 0.24 percent and in the total operated area its 
share was 2.05 percent. Among the districts, 
the number of institutional holdings ranged between
 63 in Salem and 2,583 in 
Kanniyakumari.   
 4.4. Performance of Principal Crops: 
 Achieving food security by increasing agricultural 
production forms the core of 
agricultural development strategy in the State. Thi
s policy assumes greater significance with 
the increasing population and accelerating economic
 growth.  A number of programmes have 
been launched for increasing production of agricult
ural commodities in the State at different 
points of time.  Thanks to the favourable temporal 
and spatial spread of rainfall and adequate 
availability of water both in surface and sub-surfa
ce flow for irrigation, the production of 
principal crops in the State witnessed increase  in
 2011-12 as compared to the previous year 
2010-11. The increase in production was mainly addu
ced to the increase in yield rate of 
crops rather than that of area.  In 2012-13, the si
tuation was entirely different.  The prolonged 
dry spell, the deficit rainfall during South-West M
onsoon, the uneven temporal spread during 
the North-East Monsoon and the decline in water ava
ilability in surface and sub-surface 
sources for irrigation produced adverse effect on c
ropped area and area irrigated.  On the 
other  hand, there was an increase in fallows cause
d by the wide spread drought.  The   area, 
yield and production of all crops in the State were
 affected during 2012-13.  The fall in yield 
was more pronounced than that of area.   
  During 2011-12, there was an all-time high producti
on of foodgrains at 101.52 lakh 
tonnes.  However, a wide spread drought during 2012
-13 triggered a steep decline in 
foodgrains production to 56.05 lakh tonnes (45.0%).
 The fall 
in the production of all constituents of foodgrains
 viz., rice, 
pulses and millets  caused the overall decline in f

production during 2012-13. Among them the fall in r
ice 
production was much pronounced. In the case of prod
uction 
of rice, it fell from 74.59 lakh tonnes in 2011-12 
to 40.50 lakh 
tonnes in 2012-13 (46.0%). It was mainly due to the
 fall in 
yield rate of rice rather than the drop in area. Th
e area under 
paddy declined by 22.0 percent and that of yield by
 31.0 
percent  between these two years.  The per hectare

of paddy (in terms of rice)  at  3,918 kgs during t
he year 2011-12 was the best. In 2012-13 it 
declined to 2,712 kgs.  However, the yield rate of 
the crop  also  varied  within  the  State  as 
well as among  the  seasons  significantly.  Across
 the State the yield rate of paddy ranged 
between 588 kgs per hectare in Ramanathapuram and 4
728 kgs per hectare in 
kanniyakumari districts in 2012-13.  Among the seas
ons, the normal yield (average for the 5 
years ending 2011-12) obtained at 3,799 kgs per hec
tare in Kar/Kuruvai/Sornavari season 
was the highest as compared to 2,913 kgs in 

Samba/Thaladi/Pisanam and 3,552 kgs in 

Navarai/Kodai.  In the light of limited scope for 

expanding area under cultivation and under irrigati
on, 
the only way to meet the growing food requirement, 
 is to 
narrow down the vast gap in the yield rate among th
e 
districts as well as between the seasons. This call
s for 
the need for renewed research effort to narrow down
 the 
yield gap.  In 2013-14, it is anticipated to cover 
18.49 
lakh hectares under paddy and to produce 57.26 lakh
 
tonnes of rice. 
 Coarse cereals comprise crops like jowar, cumbu, ra
gi, maize and other small millets 
(korra , varagu, samai) which have traditionally be
en the main components of the food 
basket. These crops are being grown predominantly i
n rainfed conditions. Changing 
consumption pattern, non-adoption of the recommende
d doses of inputs due to high risk 
under rainfed agro-climatic conditions, non-availab
ility of high yielding variety quality seeds 
particularly of small millets, lack of assured proc
urement and poor resource base of the 
farmers who largely grow these crops are the limiti
ng factors in increasing the area and 
production of coarse cereals.  The total millets pr
oduction in the State dwindled from 23.24 
lakh tonnes in 2011-12 to 13.42 lakh tonnes in 2012
-13 (42.3%).  Eventhough the area 
increased by 0.6 percent between these two years, t
he fall in yield rate by 43.0 percent 
caused on overall decline in millets production. Wi
th the increase in the coverage to 9.10 lakh 
hectares during 2013-14, the total production of co
arse cereals is likely to go up to 25.0 lakh 
tonnes. 
  Being rich in protein, pulses not only form a vital
 part of the human diet, but also play 
a crucial role in balancing the dietary proteins. T
he major pulse crops grown are green gram 
(24.6%), black gram (46.2%) and horse gram (10.3%) 
which accounted for 81.1 percent of 
the total area under pulses in the State in 2011-12
. Cultivation of pulses is mostly (89.4% of 
the area) under rainfed condition on marginal lands
 with less fertile soil by resource-poor 
farmers.  The wide spread drought also affected the
 area, yield and production of pulses 
during 2012-13.  The decline in area was 23.4 perce
nt 
and in yield was 25.1 percent.  This caused a fall 
in 
pulses production in the State from 3.69 lakh tonne
s in 
2011-12 to 2.13 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 (42.3%).  Th
e 
average yield rate of pulses in the State even at i
ts peak 
at 554 kgs per hectare during 2011-12 was short of 
the 
all India average 694 kgs per hectare.  The total a
rea 
under pulses is likely to go up to 7.73 lakh hectar
es in 
2013-14 and the anticipated production is 3.20 lakh
 
tonnes. Non- availability of high yielding varietie
s, low 
Seed Replacement Rate (SRR), high susceptibility to
 
pests are the primary reasons for low yield of puls
es. To 

attain higher levels in yield rates focus needs  ex
pansion in area under micro irrigation, more 
use of micro nutrients, adoption of improved produc
tion practices and evolving better yielding 
seeds.  
 Sugarcane is the most important cash crop in the 
State which is widely cultivated in irrigated condi
tions. 
Despite drought, the crop™s coverage did not suffer
 during 
2012-13.  In fact, it increased from 3.46 lakh hect
ares in 
2011-12 to 3.48 lakh hectares in 2012-13 (0.6%).  F
ixing of 
a higher State Advised Price (SAP) by the State 

Government at Rs.2,350/- per tonne linked to 9.5 pe
rcent 
recovery rate in 2012-13 as compared to that of 

Government of India™s Statutory Minimum Price of Rs
. 
1,700/- per tonne and the increase in area register
ed with 
sugar mills under the crop from 2.75 lakh hectares 
in 2011-12 to 2.81 lakh hectares in 2012-
13 were responsible for enlarging the crop™s covera
ge. Contrary to this trend, the yield rate 
fell from 113 tonnes per hectare in 2011-12 to 98 t
onnes per hectare in 2012-13.  The fall in 
yield rate was responsible for the decline in cane 
production from 389.75 lakh tonnes in 
2011-12 to 340.14 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 (12.7%).  
The recovery rate of cane also declined 
from 9.35 to 8.68 percent between these two years. 
 This underlines the need for evolving 
new varieties having more sugar content.  The cane 
production during 2013-14 is likely to be 
of the order of 375.5 lakh tonnes.   The State Gove
rnment has increased the State Advised 
Price to Rs.2,650/- per tonne this year.   
 Highly as volatile cotton prices and high cost of p
est 
control are the two major factors that limit the ex
pansion of 
area under cotton in the State.  The area under thi
s crop 
marginally fell from 1.36 lakh hectares in 2011-12 
to 1.33 
lakh hectares in 2012-13 (2.2%) and the yield rate 
(lint) from 
481 kgs to 326 kgs (32.2%). They triggered the decl
ine in 
production from 3.82 lakh bales to 2.55 lakh bales 
(33.2%) 
of cotton in the State. During 2013-14 the coverage
 under 
the crop would be 1.50 lakh hectares and that of pr
oduction 
3.18 lakh bales. Developing cotton varieties suitab
le for 
increasing yield, especially, under rainfed conditi
ons, continuous follow up of pest monitoring 
and advisory services are some of the issues meriti
ng serious attention to increase the 
production and productivity of cotton in the State.
  
 Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the State
 
on marginal lands, dependent on monsoons with low l
evel 
of input usage.  Of the total area cultivated under
 oilseeds 
edible oilseeds accounted for 99.0 percent and rest
 being 
non-edible oilseeds.  The prominent oilseeds raised
 were 
groundnut, gingelly, castor and sunflower.  The tem
poral 
and spatial spread of rainfall during the year 2012
-13 was 
not beneficial to raising of oilseeds. Consequently
, the total 
area cultivated under these crops and the average y
ield 
rate declined from 4.49 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to
 3.90 
lakh hectares in 2012-13 (13.1%) and from 2,481 kgs
 to 
2,092 kgs (15.7%) per hectare respectively. This br
ought about a fall in the overall production 
of oilseeds in the State from 11.14 lakh tonnes to 
8.16 lakh tonnes (26.8%) between these 

two years. During 2013-14 the production would be o
f the order of 10.35 lakh tonnes. The 
following measures are needed to improve the area, 
yield and production of oilseeds: i) 
minimizing the wide inter-district variations in th
e yield level by adopting suitable package of 
practices and ii) evolving hybrids/high yielding va
rieties having more oil content but at the 
same time weathering the natural calamities and pes
t and diseases attack.   
 4.5  Horticulture: 
 In the context of increasing population, swelling u
rbanization and a favourable shift in 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, there is a ne
ed for covering larger areas under 
horticulture crops. Horticulture crops in Tamil Nad
u account for nearly 17 percent of the total 
cropped area. There has been a steady increase in t
he area covered under horticulture crops 
in the recent past.  The total area covered under h
orticulture crops in the  State  moved up 
from 10.01 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 10.81 lakh h
ectares in 2012-13 (8.0%) and would  
further  rise to 11.46  lakh hectares in 2013-14 (6
.0%).  Fruits, vegetables, spices and 
condiments and plantation crops together claimed a 
share of 96.0 percent of the total area 
covered under horticultural crops. The overall yiel
d rate exhibited a steady improvement.  The 
average yield rate of horticultural crops per hecta
re improved from 15.24 tonnes in 2011-12 
to 16.09 tonnes in 2012-13 (5.6%)  and  would furth
er  improve to  16.69  tonnes   in 2013-14 
(3.7%). The increase in area and yield rate helped 
to augment the total production of 
horticultural crops from 152.62 lakh tonnes in 2011
-12 to 173.99 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 
(14.0%) and further to 191.31 lakh tonnes in 2013-1
4 (10.0%).
  During the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the State 
schemes viz., the Integrated Horticulture Developme
nt 
Schemes (IHDS) (Rs.28.59 crore), Integrated Tribal 

Development Programmes (ITDP) (Rs.2.0 crore), Weste
rn 
Ghats Development Programme (WGDP) and Hill Area 

Development Programme (HADP) (Rs. 12.40 crore) and 

National Agricultural Development Programme (NADP) 
(Rs. 
182.45 crore) were implemented.  The Centrally-Spon
sored 
Schemes like National Horticulture Mission (NHM) (R
s. 
479.01 crore), National Mission on Micro Irrigation
 (NMMI) 
(Rs. 256.01 crore), National Bamboo Mission (NBM) (
Rs. 
3.73 crore) and National Mission on Medicinal Plant
s (NMMP) (Rs. 27.30 crore) were also in 
operation.  The State also implemented the World Ba
nk assisted IAMWARM project (Rs. 72.0 
crore) for expansion of area with high value hortic
ultural crops in 61 sub-basins in Tamil 
Nadu.  Under precision farming, an extent of 22,294
 hectares was covered and 1,238

clusters were established during 2008-11.  During t
he Eleventh Five Year Plan period, an 
area of 91,130 hectares was brought under micro irr
igation. All these schemes have gone a 
long way towards enhancing the production of hortic
ultural crops. 
 Even though many schemes are being implemented for 
the promotion of horticulture 
crops, yet the following impediments are still at w
ork: i) the perishable nature limits the  extent 
of market and transaction opportunities; ii) prices
 are highly volatile due to seasonal 
conditions;  iii) inadequate and timely availabilit
y of pedigree planting materials; iv) period of 
waiting is significantly long for those seeking qui
ck return and v) lack of technical guidance for 
increasing the productivity per unit of area due to
 weak extension machinery.  
 4.6  Trend in Overall Agricultural Production:  
 Index of Agricultural Production is the summary mea
sure which shows the pulse of 
the performance in agricultural sector. In view of 
the fact that the performance of the 
agricultural sector displays wide variations from y
ear to year, the trends in area, yield and 
production are analyzed during the 10
th
 (2002-03 to 2006-07) and 11
th
 (2007-08 to 2011-12) 
Five Year Plan  periods.  
  The overall agricultural production in the State h
ad gone up at an annual average 
growth rate of 7.29 percent during the 10
th
 Five Year plan period (2002-2007).This 
accomplishment is mainly due to the increase in yie
ld rate of crops.  There was an overall 
decline in area by 0.42 percent in this period. Dur
ing this Plan period, the production of food 
crops fared better than non-food crops. Turning to 
11
th
 Five Year Plan period (2007-2012), 
the overall agricultural production in the State de
clined by an annual average rate of 2.37 
percent.  The fall both in area 

and yield rate of crops was 

mainly responsible for this 

decline during the 11
th
 Plan 
period.  As between food and 

non-food crops, even though the 

latter registered a growth of 0.33 

percent, the decline in the 
production of food crops by an annual average 3.08 
percent engendered the fall in the overall 
agricultural production in the State.  In the case 
of food crops, both area and yield rate 
witnessed negative growth in this Plan period.  In 
respect of non-food crops, only the area 
under the crops registered a fall and the increase 
in yield rate of crops compensated the fall 
in area and contributed to the overall increase in 
production.  
 4.7  Yield Gap: 
 The yield gap is also a major issue 
that contributes to agricultural stagnation in 

the State.  There is considerable yield gap 

between on-farm trials and yield actually 

realized by the farmers.  Except paddy, 

there is significant yield gap in other crops.  

The yield gap is around 50.0 percent of the 

potential yield. This is because the 

adoption of agronomic practices has not 

been uniform and widespread. Agricultural

strategy has to focus attention towards bridging th
e gap between the potential yield and the 
actual yield realized.    
 4.8  Self-Reliance in Production: 
 The ICMR had estimated the per capita 
per day nutritional requirement of rice at 370 

grams and pulses at 70 grams.  Based on 

these norms the total requirement of these 

agricultural commodities for 2013-14 was 

worked out.  A comparison was made with the 

total estimated requirement and production.  

There was a shortfall between the requirement and t
he estimated production level of rice and 
pulses.  The gap was particularly significant in re
spect of pulses and illustrates that self 
sufficiency in food production in Tamil Nadu is som
e way off.     
 4.9  Loss of Agricultural Production due to Natural
 calamities:
  
  During 2011-12, a cyclone caused extensive damages
 to paddy, millets, pulses, 
sugarcane, groundnut and coconut in the districts o
f Cuddalore, Villupuram, Thanjavur, 
Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur, Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur
, Dharmapuri and Thiruvannamalai 
during the fag end of the North-East Monsoon period
. The total area affected was 1.88 lakh 
hectares and the total value of production loss amo
unted to Rs. 968.73 crore.  The relief 
measures were sanctioned to the level of Rs.174.24 
crore benefiting 2.91 lakh farmers.   
     Coupled with the prolonged dry 

spell since January 2012, the deficit 

rainfall during the South-West Monsoon 

and the uneven temporal and spatial 

spread of rainfall during the North-East 

Monsoon caused widespread drought in 

the State during 2012-13. The State 

Government declared 31 districts of Tamil 

Nadu except Chennai as drought affected 

and sanctioned various relief  measures  

to mitigate the sufferings of the farmers. In 

overall terms the total area and production 

affected by drought in the State during the 

year was estimated at 10.01 lakh hectares 

and 32.42 lakh tonnes respectively. The 

total value of loss of crop production was 

estimated at Rs. 3475.45 crore in the State. On an 
average, the loss of crop production per 
hectare worked out to Rs.34,719. In the case of foo
d crops, the total area affected by drought 
was 8.68 lakh hectares (86.7%) and production was 2
0.90 lakh tonnes (64.5%).  The total 
estimated value of loss of foodcrop production was 
Rs. 2770 crore (79.7%).  The total area 
affected under non food crops was 1.33 lakh hectare
s (13.3%).  The quantum of production 
under non-food crops affected by drought in the Sta
te was 11.52 lakh tonnes (35.5%) and the 
estimated loss of value was Rs.705 crore (20.3%). T
he State had sanctioned relief measures 
to the tune of Rs. 1,143 crore benefiting 20.33 lak
h farmers.  Of the total farmers benefited, 
those raising food crops accounted for 89.0 percent
 and the rest of the 11.0 percent were 
non-food crops cultivators.

4.10  Input Management: 
 Crop production is essentially a function of the in
terplay of natural resources such as 
land, water, soil, biodiversity with the plant gene
tic material i.e. use of quality seeds and use 
of other agricultural inputs like chemical fertiliz
ers, organic manure, pesticides, farm 
machinery and equipment, labour, credit and insuran
ce, pricing policy and marketing 
infrastructure. This section highlights the present
 status regarding the availability and access 
of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pes
ticides, and credit which determine agricultural 
productivity and production.  
 4.10.1 Irrigation: 
  The annual per capita water availability in India 
is about 2200m
3 
whereas it is only 
about 750 m
3 
in Tamil Nadu. There are about 81 reservoirs, 41,12
7 tanks and 18.21 lakh 
wells in the State.  The total storage capacity of 

15 major reservoirs in the State is 198.38 tmcft.  

Against which water realization stood at 172.26 

tmcft in 2011-12 (86.8%).  Due to wide spread 

drought, water realization in the reservoirs in 

the State was restricted to 89.8 tmcft  in 2012-

13 (45.3%).  The decline in ground water table 

across the State is a matter of serious concern.  

As a result, out of 386 blocks in the State, 139 

blocks are categorized as over-exploited, 33 

blocks as critical, 67 blocks as semi-critical, 11 

blocks as poor quality and the balance 136 

blocks as safe.   
 The total net area irrigated in the State 
by all sources of irrigation declined from 29.64 

lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 26.43 lakh hectares 

in 2012-13 (10.8%).  There was a fall in gross 

area irrigated from 35.19 lakh hectares to 29.91 

lakh hectares (15.0%).  Canals accounted for 
22.0 percent, tanks for 16.0 percent and wells for 
62.0 percent. Eventhough the drought had 
its adverse effect on net area irrigated by differe
nt sources, it was more pronounced in the 
case of surface flow sources.  

It was 20.4 percent in the 

case of tanks and 20.9 

percent in respect of canals. 

The fall in net area irrigated 

by wells during 2012-13 was 

3.4 percent as compared to 

2011-12. The irrigation 

intensity in the State declined 

from 119.0 percent in 2011-12 

to 113.2 percent in 2012-13.   
 Water demand is increasing rapidly due to populatio
n growth, urbanization and 
changing lifestyle. Owing to increasing demand of w
ater for domestic, industrial and energy 
uses, there is a severe constraint in the availabil
ity of water for agriculture. Climate change

Chennai-6. 

might complicate further the existing temporal and 
spatial variation in availability of water. 
Extreme events like floods and droughts are occurri
ng more frequently and affecting 
livelihood and food security. Low water use efficie
ncy and inadequate maintenance of 
irrigation systems are some of the major problems t
hat confront the management of water 
resources in the State. There is a need to promote 
participatory management of aquifers to 
ensure sustainable and equitable use of water. Prom
otion of micro-irrigation techniques, 
alignment of cropping patterns with the availabilit
y of water and greater involvement and 
empowerment of Water Users™ Associations in the com
mand areas could lead to 
improvement in water use efficiency.   
 With a view to improve the service delivery of the 
irrigation system and to increase the 
productivity with effective integrated water resour
ces management in a sub-basin frame work, 
a multi-sector  project Irrigated Agriculture Moder
nization and Water Bodies Restoration and 
Management Project (IAMWARM) with financial assista
nce of World Bank is being 
implemented in the State .  Between 2007-08 and 201
3-14, project rehabilitation works in 
4,549 tanks, 655 anaicuts and 8,018 k.m length of s
upply channels had been completed to 
benefit 6.69 lakh hectares with an expenditure of R
s.1,284 crores.  With the financial 
assistance of the Central and State Governments (50
:50), the Command Area Development 
Programme is currently being implemented in the Sta
te in Vaigai reservoir, Kodadanar 
reservoir, Varadhamanadhi reservoir, Kalingarayan a
naicut, Pelandurai anaicut, Cheyyur 
anaicut, Ellis anaicut and Manimutharu nadhi system
.  During 2012-13, on-farm development 
works were carried out to benefit 18,262 hectares a
t a cost of Rs.27.95 crore and Rotational 
Water Supply to benefit 18,267 hectares at a cost o
f Rs.0.60 crore. In 2013-14, on-farm 
development works are to be taken up to benefit an 
extent of area of 4,778 hectares at a total 
cost of Rs.38.83 crore under this programme.  Rotat
ional Water Supply works are also to be 
taken up to benefit 3,213 hectares at a cost of Rs.
0.78 crores. 
  Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation str
uctures is taken up under the 
National Agriculture Development Programme.  For 20
12-13, out of 14 works accorded 
sanction at a cost of Rs. 9.21 crore, 7 works were 
completed.  The 13
th
 Finance Commission 
had recommended a grant of Rs. 200 crores for resto
ration of 674 traditional water bodies 
over a period of four years since 2011-12. During 2
012-13, 175 works were taken up at a 
cost Rs. 50 crore.  The Government has taken initia
tives to replenish the ground water 
potential through rain water harvesting and recharg
e structures.  Under Master Plan Artificial 
Recharge Scheme, the State had sanctioned Rs.550 cr
ores towards restoring the depleted 
aquifers through construction of check dams across 
rivers, streams, percolation ponds and 
recharge shafts.  Under the scheme, as against the 
target of 523 works, 429 works were 
completed at a total cost of Rs.199.66 crore up to 
2012-13.  The remaining 94 works at a cost 
of Rs. 65.45 crore are being taken up during the ye
ar 2013-14.  Under various schemes, 82 
percolation ponds at a cost of Rs.4.55 crore and fa
rm ponds numbering 320 were created at 
a cost of Rs.2.05 crore.   
 4.10.2 Seeds:    
 Quality seeds and planting materials are key 
agricultural inputs, which determine the productivi
ty of 
crops.  It is estimated that the quality of seed ac
counts 
for 20-25 percent of productivity. As a result of t
he 
adverse weather conditions, the quantum of supply o
f 
seeds in the State declined from 99,390 tonnes in 2
011-
12 to 73,033 tonnes in 2012-13.  In 2013-14 ( upto 
Feb 

2014), the supply of seeds  is 84,530 tonnes.  Howe
ver, as against the total estimated 
requirements, there was a persistent short fall in 
the supply of seeds by the organized sector 
(public and private) in the State. The short fall w
as conspicuous in respect of pulses, oil 
seeds and millets.  The organized sector had met on
ly 43 to 45 percent of the total seed 
requirements in the State. A larger portion of seed
 requirement i.e. about 57 to 55 percent 
continues to be met from the unorganized sector i.e
., mainly farm-saved seeds. Of the total 
quantum of seeds distributed by the organized secto
r during 2012-13, paddy alone 
accounted for 78.0 percent.  As against the stipula
ted seed replacement rate of 33.0 percent 
in respect of paddy, pulses and oilseeds and 50.0 p
ercent  for millets and cotton,  the actual 
rate fell short of in the case of pulses and oilsee
ds.  
 There is a need to develop better varieties/hybrids
/planting materials, which will be 
able to manifest itself even under challenging agro
-climatic conditions. The provision of 
subsidy for seeds for newer and older varieties nee
ds to be rationalized. The time is right to 
prepare a long term Seed Plan for the State keeping
 in mind the agro-climatic conditions, 
farmers™ requirements, SRR of the crops, State™s cr
op calendar and any contingent situations 
that may arise in order to ensure availability of q
uality seed at the right time to the farmers. In 
the absence of such a seed plan, farmers are forced
 to fall back on ‚farm-saved™ seeds or 
Truthfully Labelled Seeds.  Steps need to be taken 
to prepare a Seed Plan for 5 years. Seed 
Replacement needs the serious attention it deserves
.  
 4.10.3 Integrated Nutrient Management:
  
 Chemical fertilizers are the immediate source of nu
trients in the soils. In the State, a 
total number of 11,780 retail outlets effect fertil
izer distribution of which private retail outlets 
accounted for 63.0 percent and the rest being co-op
erative outlets. With the decline in 
cropped area as well as irrigated area consequent t
o the widespread drought, the total 
consumption of nitrogenous (N), 

phosphatic (P), potassic (K) fertilizers in 

the State declined to 13.74 lakh tonnes in 

2012-13 from 18.13 lakh tonnes in 2011-

12.  Eventhough, the three constituents 

witnessed a shortfall during 2012-13, it was 

much sharper in phosphatic (P) and 

potassic (K). In 2013-14, with the normal 

monsoon and increase in cropped as well 
as irrigated area, the total fertilizer consumption
 in the State would likely to go up to 13.88 
lakh tonnes.   
 The consumption of NPK in the State is found to be 
in the ratio of 4:1:1 in 2012-13 as 
against the conventionally accepted ratio of 4:2:1 
indicating imbalances in the application of 
three chemical nutrients.  Continuation of subsidy 
on urea while decontrolling phosphate and

potash fertilizers further adds to the inadvertent 
promotion of imbalance in fertilizer use on the 
one hand and excessive use of nitrogenous fertilize
r on 
the other hand, leading to environmental pollution 
and 
lowering of profits to the farmers. The crop- wise 

consumption revealed that    paddy alone accounted 
for 
more than 50 percent of the total fertilizer consum
ption in 
the State.   
The average per hectare 
fertilizer consumption in the State 

declined from 438 kgs in 2011-12 

to 235 kgs in 2012-13.  In 2013-

14, it is expected to be  of the 

order of 308 kgs.  The all-India 

average consumption of fertilizers 

remained stable at 144 kgs per 

ha in 2011-12 when compared to 

the previous year. Very high 

variability was observed in 

fertilizer consumption among the 

districts.  Across the State, it was 

the highest in Madurai (669 Kgs) 

and lowest in Tiruppur (7 kg) 

districts in 2012-13.   
 The major constraints for adopting rational crop nu
trition schedules are (a) high cost
 of straight fertilizers of nutrients other than NPK
 and Zinc; (b) lack of strong policy support 
from the Government of India for balanced fertilize
r use and (c) lack of awareness among the 
farmers. 
 The Government is strictly monitoring the quality o
f the fertilizers through 14 Fertilizer 
Control Laboratories.  During 2012-13, a total of 1
6,540 samples were tested of which 436 
samples were found sub-standard.  It was programmed
 to analyze 17,500 fertilizer samples 
during 2013-14.   
  
 Micro nutrients are best applied through 

fortification of major fertilizers.  They have a 

significant impact on plant growth and life.  A 

total quantity of  1,626 tonnes of micro nutrients 

were produced in 2012-13 and  1,392 tonnes 

were supplied.  In 2013-14, it was programmed 

to produce 1,600 tonnes and to distribute entire 

quantity.  The crop -wise micro nutrient 

distribution during 2012-13 reveals that paddy 

accounted for 68.3 percent followed by coconut 

(10.6%), groundnut (6.6%) cotton and millets 

(4.4% each) and pulses (3.4%) and the rest being ot
her crops.

A total quantity of 2,380 tonnes of bio-fertilizers
 was produced from the 15 centres out 
of which 2,180 tonnes were distributed to cover 4.8
8 lakh hectares benefitting 3.45 lakh 
farmers in 2012-13. In 2013-14, it is proposed to p
roduce and distribute 3,850 tonnes of bio-
fertilizers in the State.  
 Comprehensive and authentic database on micro nutri
ent/bio- fertilizer production and 
distribution in the State by public and private sec
tors needs to be built up for the benefit of all 
the stakeholders. With a view to ensure availabilit
y of true to type of micro nutrient/bio 
fertilizers to farmers; to curb sale of spurious an
d poor quality produce; to protect the rights of 
farmers; and to increase private participation in p
roduction and distribution, quality control 
needs to be enforced with utmost urgency on par wit
h international standards. 
 4.10.4 Integrated Pest Management: 
  The protection of crops from predations of pests a
nd diseases is a sine qua non for 
higher agricultural productivity, increased farm in
comes and enhanced food security for the 
nation.  Anecdotal evidence revealed that there is 
a production loss up to 30 percent due to 
incursion of pests and diseases. With the primary o
bjective of reducing the use of harmful 
pesticides and integrating as many non-chemical met
hods, Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) has been implemented in a cost-effective mann
er since late 1980s in the State.  It 
emphasizes promoting eco-friendly, bio-pesticide te
chnology at the field level.  Consequent to 
the implementation of IPM Technology and the fall i
n area cultivated, the technical grade 
material consumption in the State which was 10,926 
tonnes in 1984-85 drastically come 
down to 2,261 tonnes in 2011-12 and further to 2,20
7 tonnes in 2012-13.  Between these two 
years it is noteworthy that use of chemical pestici
des in the State declined from 385 grams 
per hectare to 375 grams per hectare.  Compared to 
the global average of 500 grams of 
technical grade pesticide per hectare it was on the
 low side.  The chemical pesticides are 
sold through 11,093 retail outlets of which 89.0 pe
rcent were in the private sector, 8.0 percent 
in the Government sector and 3.0 percent co-operati
ves.  Consequent to the decline in area 
cropped due to widespread drought, the total area t
reated under various plant protection 
measures had come down to 35.72 lakh hectares in 20
12-13 as against 38.30 lakh hectares 
in the previous year.  Of the total area treated, p
addy accounted for 42.0 percent followed by 
millets (19.0%), pulses (15.0%), sugarcane and grou
ndnut (10.0% each) and cotton (4.0%).    
 Certain special initiatives that can be taken up fo
r the effective implementation of IPM 
so as to produce safe and clean agricultural produc
e in a cost effective manner include: (a) 
training farmers on IPM Technology and educating th
em about the ill effects of indiscriminate 
use of pesticides; (b) encouraging the private sect
or to produce bio-pesticides; (c) regulating 
the sale of chemical pesticides and preventing misu
se; (d) developing indigenous and cost 
effective pheromones; and (e) ensuring availability
 of critical inputs  in right time.   
 4.10.5 Crop Insurance:  
 With a view to insulate the 
farmers against the loss occurred due 

to natural calamities, large scale 

outbreak of pests and diseases and 

to ensure credit worthiness for  the 

ensuing season,  the Agricultural  

Insurance Company of  India Limited   

implements  the National  Agricultural Insurance Sc
heme in the State.  The unit of insurance 
under the scheme is block depending on the area und
er the crop notified.  Under the

scheme, the total number of farmers insured their c
rops in the State increased from 4.89 
lakhs in 2011-12 to 10.83 lakhs in 2012-13.   The t
otal area insured under the scheme had 
gone up from 7.03 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 12.35
 lakh hectares in 2012-13 with the total 
sum insured at Rs.1,686 crores and Rs.3,402 crores 
respectively.  In 2013-14 (up to 
October), 0.15 lakh hectares were insured for a sum
 Rs.46 crores.  Of the total area covered, 
paddy, banana, black gram, sugarcane and maize toge
ther accounted for more than 90  
percent  in both  the years.  Claims to the tune of
 Rs.40 crore were paid to benefit 0.42 lakh 
farmers in 2011-12 and Rs. 744 crore to 5.57 lakh f
armers in 2012-13.  Research to evolve 
location specific insurance products and enhancing 
insurance education for the small and 
marginal farmers is the need of the hour.    
 The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme stipulat
es the premium level of 2.0 
percent to 3.5 percent of the sum insured.  Of this
, the State has extended 50 percent 
premium subsidy enabling the farmers only to pay 1.
0 percent to 1.75 percent of the sum 
insured. The Government of India has introduced a n
ew National Crop Insurance Scheme 
(NCIS) with two components ﬁModified National Agric
ultural Insurance Schemeﬂ and 
ﬁWeather Based Crop Insurance Schemeﬂ from Rabi 201
3-14 onwards by withdrawing  the 
National Agricultural Insurance Scheme. Under the n
ew Modified National Agricultural 
Insurance Scheme which is implemented in all distri
cts from Rabi 2013-14, the premium 
payable by the farmers increases to 3.75 percent.  
With a view to encourage the farmers to 
adopt the agricultural crop insurance on a large sc
ale so as to enable them to mitigate the 
crop losses and continue their agricultural operati
ons in a sustainable manner, the State 
Government has made a strong plea to the Central Go
vernment to equally share the 
increased commitment on premium for the farmers ove
r and above 2.0 percent of the sum 
insured.   
 4.10.6 Institutional Credit: 
  Timely availability of credit 
at reasonable rates especially to 

small and marginal farmers is 

crucial for agricultural growth.  

Public sector banks, co-operative 

banks and regional rural banks 

play an important role in meeting 

the entire crop loans needs in the 

State.  Of the total credit disbursed 

by the above institutions, the share 

of the farm sector increased from 

53.7 percent in 2011-12 to 60.3 

percent in 2012-13. The quantum 

of crop loan disbursed in the State 

by these institutions steadily increased from Rs. 3
4,432 crore in 2011-12 to Rs. 51,991 crore 
in 2012-13 (51.0%).  It was planned to disburse cro
p loans to the tune of Rs. 48,657 crores in 
2013-14.  Of the total crop loan disbursed, paddy, 
plantation and horticulture crops together 
accounted for a sizable share of about 72.0 percent
 in both the years.  During 2012-13 in 
respect of paddy, oil seeds, turmeric, sugarcane an
d plantation and horticulture crops the 
disbursement of crop credit exceeded the respective
 targets. 
 A meagre 4.0 percent of the total institutional cre
dit for the farm sector had been 
utilized for infrastructure development viz., minor
 irrigation (Rs. 859 crore), land development

(Rs.404 crore), farm mechanization (Rs.1,119 crore)
 and storage/market yard (Rs. 190 crore) 
in 2012-13.   
 Vast extent of agricultural lands is given on lease
 for small and marginal 
farmers/agricultural labourers due to migration of 
land owners, labour problems and other 
reasons.  These tenant farmers are not able to secu
re credit from banks and have to depend 
on informal sources of credit for taking up cultiva
tion.  There is need for bringing them into 
banking fold and facilitate provision of credit for
 farming operations.   
 4.10.7 Agriculture Marketing: 
 Owing to a number of factors such as inadequate sto
rage facilities, lack of quick and 
economical means of transportation, perishability o
f farm produce, poor withholding capacity 
of the farmers and urgent credit needs, the unorgan
ized sector comprising wholesale 
merchants, commission agents and other intermediari
es continue to dominate the sphere of 
agricultural marketing in the State.  With the 

aim to create infrastructure and to regulate 

agricultural produce trade activities, the State 

Government enacted the Tamil Nadu 

Agricultural Marketing (Regulation) Act 1987 

and Rules 1991 replacing the earlier Act of 

1959.   At present, 21 Marketing Committees 

are functioning at the district level.  Under their
 
control, 277 Regulated Markets are functioning 

in the State. Among them 66.0 percent 
transacted business of 5,000 metric tonnes per annu
m, 18.0 percent 2,000 to 5,000 mt of 
produce and 16.0 percent less than 2,000 mt per ann
um. The total number of licensed 
traders engaged in the transaction of agricultural 
produce in the regulated markets increased 
from 27,620 in 2011-12 to 28,253 in 2012-13.   Due 
to the wide spread drought, the total 
quantum of agricultural produce transacted in the r
egulated markets fell from 18.97 lakh 
tonnes in 2011-12 to 17.43 lakh tonnes in 2012-13. 
 With the prevailing favourable 
agricultural scenario in the State during 2013-14, 
it was programmed to transact 27.30 lakh 
tonnes.  The total value of agricultural commoditie
s transacted by these regulated markets 
during 2012-13 was Rs.3, 116 crore, of which food c
rops accounted for a major share of 68.0 
percent and the remaining being non-food crops.  Up
to the end of October 2013, the total 
value of transactions stood at Rs. 1,508 crore.  
  Grading of agricultural commodities has three main
 purposes, namely, (a) to promote 
common trade language and avoid the need for physic
al checking and handling at many 
points; (b) to protect consumers by ensuring qualit
y of product purchases; and (c) to protect 
the producer from exploitation by ensuring prices c
ommensurate to the quality of produce. 
Total quantum of agricultural produce graded in the
 State increased from 2.59 lakh tonnes in 
2011-12 to 3.0 lakh tonnes in 2012-13.   
 Market information is an important tool in the agri
cultural marketing system. 189 
regulated markets upload prevailing agricultural pr
oduce price and arrivals on an electronic 
portal on a daily basis.  Apart from this, 179 farm
ers™ markets had also disseminated price 
details.  To minimize the loss after harvest during
 drying, cleaning and winnowing, 1,359 
village level drying yards were constructed at a to
tal cost of Rs. 27.35 crore.   Four Agri 
Export Zones were established in the PPP mode at Ho
sur, Ooty, Nilakottai and Panruti to 
facilitate value addition for agricultural products
 and to minimize post-harvest losses. It 
ensures steady and better price  realization  to th
e farming community as well as availability

of commodities in processed  form  to the  consumer
s throughout the year.   The total 
turnover of these zones during 2012-13 was Rs. 3.01
 crore.  
 In the co-operative fold, 110 Primary Co-
operative Marketing Societies transacted 

agricultural produce of a total value of Rs.552 

crore in 2012-13.  Up to October 2013, the total 

value of transaction was Rs. 163 crore.  Of the 

total value of transaction cotton alone accounted 

for a sizable share of 44.0 percent.  
 Food and agricultural commodity prices are 
primarily determined by domestic demand and 

supply factors.  Consequently, there is a wide gap 

between the prices received by the farmers and 

the prices paid by the consumer. At times, the farm
ers are not able to receive a price to cover 
the cost of production while the consumers are payi
ng an abnormally high price for the same 
commodity. This is a major concern for the policy m
akers. High food inflation with an 
inadequate supply response, aggravated by logistics
 and market-related constraints are other 
areas requiring attention. Further, to provide a hi
gher share of consumer prices to the 
farmers, there is a need to reduce the multiple lay
ers of intermediaries by providing 
alternative marketing channels.  Creation of scient
ific storages nearer to the farms is 
necessary so as to avoid wastage and produce deteri
oration. Enlarging the scope of 
provision of institutional credit to the farmers th
rough various instruments like pledge 
financing, so that they are not compelled to sell t
he produce at distress price is also 
necessary.  Supply of market information and extens
ion services to advise farmers on 
marketing, capacity-building in marketing; developm
ent of marketing linkages between 
farmers, agribusinesses and large retailers may be 
developed through cooperatives, contract 
farming or associations of stakeholders representin
g different interest groups like farmers, 
input suppliers, agricultural produce processers, e
tc.  
 4.11. Highlights of Major Schemes Implemented in th
e State: 
 The State has taken all efforts to increase agricul
tural production, enhance 
productivity and explore the untapped potential.  T
he Central Government also supplements 
the efforts of the State through implementation of 
Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector 
Schemes.    
 Development of wasteland/degraded land and improvin
g rainfed farming is crucial 
towards attaining self sufficiency in crop producti
on.  Towards achieving this goal, various 
area and location specific programmes viz., Drought
 Prone Area Programme (DPAP), 
Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP), 
Integrated Watershed Management 
Programme (IWMP), National Watershed Development Pr
oject for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA) 
are being implemented in the State over a period of
 time on watershed basis with the 
participatory approach. During 2012-13, the total a
rea treated under these programmes was 
1.47 lakh hectares at a cost of Rs. 186.13 crores. 
    With a view to improve the yield rate and product
ion of rice,  System of Rice 
Intensification (SRI) is being implemented in the S
tate.  During 2012-13, it had  adopted  the 
whole  village  concept in 1,719  villages covering
 an area of 1.68 lakh  hectares.  During 
2013-14, the scheme would be implemented in 2,000 v
illages covering an area of 1.90 lakh 
hectares.

Chennai -   10. 

To enhance the production of rice and pulses on mis
sion mode approach, the 
National Food Security Mission (NFSM) is implemente
d since 2007-08.  Under the scheme 
Rs.22.87 crores was spent during 2012-13 towards pr
omotion of rice in five districts viz., 
Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Sivagangai, Pudukkottai a
nd Ramanathapuram. Under this 
programme,  it was contemplated to improve pulses p
roduction in all districts except Chennai 
and The Nilgiris.  Various activities were taken up
 at a cost of Rs. 14.76 crores.   
 With the aim to increase productivity of oilseeds, 
pulses, oil palm and maize, the 
Integrated Scheme for Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil palm an
d Maize (ISOPOM) is implemented since 
2004-05 with region specific strategies.  From 2010
-11 onwards, since pulses have been 
integrated with the NFSM, ISOPOM scheme was  implem
ented only for oilseeds, oil palm 
and maize at a cost of Rs.18.51 crores  during 2012
-13.   
 Under National Mission on Micro Irrigation, instill
ation of sprinkler irrigation for 
sugarcane, cotton, maize, pulses, groundnut and hor
ticultural crops is taken up.  During 
2012-13 this scheme has been implemented by Tamil N
adu Horticulture Development 
Agency (TANHODA) at a cost of Rs. 135.34 crores ben
efiting an area of 26,538 hectares.  It 
has been proposed to cover 47,800 hectare at an out
lay of Rs. 372.84 crores in 2013-14.  
Under the World Bank aided programme IAMWARM, crop 
demonstration, distribution of 
agricultural implements, farmers training and capac
ity building are being taken up at an 
outlay of Rs. 98.00 crore.  The total expenditure i
ncurred upto 2012-13 was Rs. 81.27 crores.  
   
With the success in achieving an increase of 30 Œ 5
0 percent in productivity due to 
adoption of high yielding/hybrid seeds, micro irrig
ation and fertigation in vegetables, turmeric, 
banana, precision farming is successfully implement
ed from 2008 onwards.  During 2012-13, 
at 50 percent subsidy, it was implemented at a cost
 of Rs. 9.25 crore benefiting 4,961 
hectares.   
 For promotion of horticulture in rainfed area, Rain
fed Area Development Programme 
(RADP) was implemented in 2,655 acres at a cost of 
Rs. 8.79 crores during 2012-13.  
  
Towards augmenting mechanization in agriculture und
er National Agricultural 
Development Programme (NADP) subsidy assistance to 
individual farmers for purchasing 
agricultural machinery so as to take up timely sowi
ng, transplanting, weeding, plant protection 
and harvesting and to overcome the acute farm worke
rs scarcity during 2012-13 total subsidy 
assistance of Rs. 73.45 crore was provided to the f
armers for purchasing 41,328 machineries 
for agriculture purposes.     
   
4.12. A Way Forward:  
  To meet the growing demand for agricultural produce
 and to ensure food security, the 
following measures are proposed:-  
  For achieving a farm output growth of 5 percent, i
ncremental productivity gains and 
technology diffusion are imperative.   
 Agriculture growth targeted in the Five Year Plans
 has often not been achieved due to 
high degree of uncertainty of the monsoon.  In this
 context, dry land farming, crop 
diversification and conservation of water through p
recision farming and waste land 
development are indispensible.   
 For nutritional security, special thrust is requir
ed for higher production and productivity 
level in pulses, oilseeds and fruits and vegetables
.  
 Sufficient public sector investment in agriculture
 sector is central to agricultural planning.  

 Ground water is still perceived as individual prop
erty and is exploited inequitably and 
without any consideration to sustainability.  It le
ads to over exploitation.  This needs to be 
properly regulated.   
 Existing resource infrastructure is not 
being properly maintained resulting in 

under utilization of available resources. 

Maintenance of existing water bodies 

may be assigned top most priority. Local 

bodies as well as stakeholders should be 

involved in the process.    
 Encroachment and diversion of water 
bodies must not be allowed and 

wherever it has taken place it should be 

restored to the extent feasible.   
 Water Users Associations should be 
given statutory power to collect and 

retain a portion of water charges and 

maintain the distribution system in their 

jurisdiction.    
 A higher proportion of farmers rely on farm-saved 
seeds leading to low seed replacement 
rate.  It is desirable to achieve the required and 
recommended seed replacement rate to 
accomplish higher production and productivity. 
 There is skewness in the application of chemical f
ertilizers (NPK).  There is overdose of 
nitrogenous and limited doses of phosphotic and pot
ash fertilizers application.  Farmers 
are to be educated enough to apply balanced applica
tion of fertilizers.  It required 
appropriate price incentives.   
 Cost-effective and productivity-enhancing System o
f Rice Intensification is to be 
implemented with efficacy and pragmatism. 
 Reforms in extension services are needed to ensure
 smooth transfer of agriculture 
technology and information to the farming communiti
es.    
 Exhaustion of yield potential of high yielding var
ieties in rice is to be overcome. 
 Post harvest value addition is to be improved and 
upgraded with adequate public 
investment.   
 Efficient markets with a dynamic supply chain is i
ndispensable for the development of the 
agricultural sector.   
 With respect to horticulture, marketing initiative
s are to be taken to promote modern 
terminal markets for fruits, vegetable and other pe
rishables in the important urban 
centres. The terminal markets will operate on a hub
-and-spoke format wherein the 
terminal markets are linked to a number of collecti
on centres located in key production 
centres to allow easy access to farmers for marketi
ng of their produce. 
 There are wide yield gaps across the State.  Agric
ulture production can be substantially 
increased if the yield gap will be addressed proper
ly through technological and policy 
intervention.   
 Awareness on crop insurance among the farmers may 
be enhanced.  
 To sum up, agriculture development is predicated by
 improvement in farm production 
and productivity, better utilization of agriculture
 inputs, proper marketing infrastructure and 
support, stepping up of investment in agriculture w
ith due regard and environmental concerns 
and efficient food management.   

  Strategies of Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 
 The Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 has a three pronged stra
tegies 
for improving productivity and thereby sustaining g
rowth in 
agriculture production so as to meet the growing de
mand for 
the agricultural produce and as well as ensuring fo
od security.  
The Strategies are: 
· Improving productivity by introducing scientific 

agricultural methods and building an institutional 

network to support the continued adoption of the sa
me. 
· Ensuring timely irrigation by intelligent use of ava
ilable 
water by adopting effective recharging mechanisms, 

drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, timely cleaning 
and 
deepening of tanks and canals, and adopting 

appropriate cropping pattern based on water 

availability. 
· Developing suitable post harvest infrastructure to 

maximize the benefits of value addition and timely 

marketing of produce.  The State will also extend 

agricultural extension activities to cover the enti
re 
farming community.
