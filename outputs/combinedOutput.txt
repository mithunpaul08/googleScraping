 yield rate per unit of land/ water. Apart 

from that, for attaining higher levels of productio
n, considerable importance is accorded to 
crop-specific strategies. New strategies are being 
evolved to break yield barriers, to utilize 
inputs more efficiently and diversify to more susta
inable and higher value crops. 
 In the above backdrop, the performance of the agric
ultural sector during 2011-12 and 
2012-13 is fully reviewed using the data available.
 For 2013-14, the prospects of the 
agricultural sector are based on the data available
, forecasts and projections made and target 
set.  
 4.1. Agriculture Prospects Œ 2013-14 
 The overall crop prospects in the State during 2013
 Œ 14 are encouraging.  During the 
current year the onset of the South-West Monsoon wa
s in time. The temporal spread of 
rainfall during this monsoon was by and large favou
rable for raising crops.  It was ‚excess™ in 
June and August and ‚normal™ in September. The spat
ial spread indicated that it was ‚normal™ 
in 17 districts, ‚excess™ in 7 districts, ‚deficit™
 in 6 districts and ‚scanty™ in 2 districts.  Thus,
 the 
spatial spread benefited 73.0 percent of the total 
geographical area of the State spread over 
24 districts.  The total quantum of rainfall receiv
ed  from this  season at 325.4 mm  was  rated  
as ‚normal™. The temporal and spatial 

spread of rainfall during this monsoon was 

also helpful in recharging the groundwater 

considerably. Apart from this, the monsoon 

brought copious inflows into the State™s 

surface flow sources and built up adequate  

storages. In tune with the requirements of 

the farmers, the release of water from the 

main reservoir viz., Mettur dam since 2
rd
 August 2013 was regulated in a systematic 

manner with adequate quantity. The 

release of water from other important 
reservoirs was also in accordance with the requirem
ents of the farmers. 
 The irrigation scenario in the State during the cur
rent year 2013 Œ 14 has turned out to 
be encouraging.  This resulted in an increase in th
e area under irrigated cropping in the 
State. Besides, the Government made fool-proof arra
ngements for the timely and adequate 
supply of all necessary inputs through Agricultural
 Extension Centres. The Co-operative 
Societies were geared up to provide adequate crop l
oans to the eligible farmers. The State 
Government provided uninterrupted 12 hours three ph
ase power supply to the delta districts 
and 8 hours for non-delta districts for encouraging
 the farmers to take up agricultural activities 
with sub-surface water.   All these efforts of the 
State were aimed to motivate the farmers and 
to redouble their efforts to take up agricultural a
ctivities with more vigour during the current 
year.  
 The intervention of North-East Monsoon during the y
ear was in time.  However, the 
rainfall received was in deficit during the entire 
season.  It was (-) 29.6 percent in October 
2013, (-) 33.7 percent in November 2013 and (-) 39.
3 percent in December 2013.  During this 
monsoon period, as against the normal level of 440.
4 mm, the actual rainfall received in the 
State was 294.3 mm (-33.2%).  The spatial spread al
so was uneven.  The uneven distribution 
of rainfall over time and space during the North-Ea
st Monsoon would have some adverse 
impact on the standing crops and crops grown mainly
 under rainfed conditions. The carry-
over storages in the surface flow sources that came
 from the South-West Monsoon were 
utilized.  As a result, it is hoped to bring in mor
e area under cultivation, area irrigated and to

reduce current fallows to a considerable extent as 
compared to the level of 2012-13. All these 
factors would be conducive for the agricultural sec
tor to recover from the impact of drought 
witnessed in the previous year 2012-13 during 2013-
14. Ultimately, the overall cropping 
scenario in the State for the year is turning out t
o be encouraging.   
 With the favourable interplay of the above factors,
 the State forecasts to attain higher 
crop production during 2013-14 as compared to 2012-
13. This would be possible with an 
increase in the coverage of area under cropping as 
well as the yield of crops.  As per Second 
Advance Estimates for 2013-14 the expected rate of 
increase in the production of foodgrains 
would be from 56.05 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 to 85.46
 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 (53.0%), 
groundnut from 7.85 lakh tonnes to 9.90 lakh tonnes
 (26.0%), cotton from 2.55 lakh bales to 
3.18 lakh bales (25.0%) and sugarcane from 340.14 l
akh tonnes to 375.46 lakh tonnes  
(10.0%).  Ultimately the contribution of the agricu
ltural sector to Gross State Domestic 
Product (GSDP) is anticipated to register a higher 
order growth 8.22 per cent during the 
current year 2013-14 as against the 5.0 percent con
templated during the 12
th
 Five Year Plan.     
 4.2. Agricultural Performance during 2011 Œ 12 and 
2012 Œ 13: 
  The agricultural sector witnessed a severe drought
 impacting the area, yield and 
production of all important crops in the State duri
ng 2012 Œ 13.  This brought about a steep 
fall of 13.04 percent in the Gross State 

Domestic Product (GSDP) of the 

agricultural sub sector between 2011 Œ 

12 and 2012 - 13.  As a result, the 

relative share of the sub sector in the 

primary sector declined from 83.0 

percent in 2011 Œ 12 to 80.0 percent in 

2012 Œ 13 and in overall State™s GSDP 

from 7.4 percent to 6.2 percent.  
 The ‚deficit rainfall™ during the pre-monsoon perio
d viz., January 2012 Œ May 2012 (-) 
39.9 percent, South-West Monsoon period June 2012  
Œ September 2012  (-)24 percent and 
the  ‚uneven temporal spread™ of the northeast mons
oon (October +42.0%, November (-) 
54.0% & December (-) 62.0%), coupled with non-relea
se of Cauvery water for agricultural 
purposes by Karnataka State and depletion of ground
water level had its adverse impact on 
‚surface™ and ‚sub-surface™ water level during the 
year 2012 Œ 13. As against the total storage 
capacity of 198.384 tmcft in 15 major irrigation re
servoirs in the State, the live storage by the 
end of December 2012 was only 31.28 tmcft (16%). Th
e storage in these reservoirs in 2011 
was comfortably high at 68.0 percent and the live s
torage was 134.70 tmcft.  The average

average fall in the ground water level in the State
 between January 2012 and 2013 was from 
5.37 meters to 7.34 meters i.e., by 1.97 meters.   
 As against the normal rainfall of 921.0 mm, the tot
al quantum of rainfall received 
during the year 2012 Œ13 was 743.1 mm.  Eventhough 
it was rated as normal, the continuous 
long dry spell in the State, had its adverse impact
 on ‚surface™ and ‚sub-surface™ water caused 
‚drought™ affecting agricultural activities in the 
State. 
 The adverse effect of the 
drought got reflected in the 

reduction in gross area sown by 

12.7 percent, gross area irrigated 

by 15.0 percent and increase in 

fallows by 17.3 percent in 2012 Œ 13 

as compared to 2011 Œ 12.  The 

cropping intensity declined from

percent in 2012-13 and that of 

irrigation intensity from 119.0 percent to 113.2 pe
rcent.   
  
Based on the report of the High Level Committee and
 taking into account the 
prevailing drought situation, in February 2013, the
 Government declared 31 districts of Tamil 
Nadu except Chennai as drought-affected and sanctio
ned various relief measures separately 
for delta and non-delta districts. Apart from this,
 a Drought Memorandum seeking assistance 
of Rs.19, 665.13 crore was sent to Government of In
dia.  
 4. 3. Land Holdings:       
            
A combination of factors such as
 i
ncreasing 
industrialization, urbanization, housing activities
 and 
infrastructure development triggered the conversion
 of 
agricultural land into non agricultural uses. This 
has 
resulted in a decline of the area under cultivation
. The 
scope for expansion of the area available for culti
vation is 
also very limited.  The pattern of land ownership i
mposes 
limitations on the models that can be adopted for 

agricultural development.  As per the latest Agricu
ltural 
Census 2010-11, marginal and small holdings   of
 less 
than 2 hectares accounted for 92.0 percent of the t
otal 
holdings and 61.0 percent of the total operated are
a. They in turn are unsuitable for 
conventional technology and machinery use to boost 
agricultural production. This led to a 
process of marginalization of small and marginal fa
rmers and casualization of agricultural 
labourers. To derive the best results and to empowe
r marginal and small farmers, they may 
be motivated to form farmers™ groups so as to get a
ll the technical inputs in time and to 
ensure judicious use of various scarce resources.
  The total number of operational land holdings in th
e State declined from 81.93 lakh in 
2005 Œ 06 to 81.18 lakh in 2010 Œ 11 (0.9%).  This 
implies that the farmers may have given 
up their cultivation because of the lucrative price
 offered for land on account of fast 
urbanization. This was more prevalent in the vicini
ty of urban areas.  Among the districts, the 
number of land holdings was the lowest in The Nilgi
ris (64,369) and the highest in

Villuppuram (6,15,543). Tamil Nadu™s share of the t
otal all-India operational holdings as per 
the 2010-11 Agricultural Census at 137.8 million wa
s 5.9 percent.  With continuous 
fragmentation of small (1 to 2 hectares), medium (2
 to 10 hectares) and large (10 hectares 
and above) holdings, the number of marginal holding
s increased in the State from 62.28 lakh 
to 62.66 lakh (0.6%) between the two Censuses. The 
share of marginal and small holdings in 
total holdings in the State rose from 91.1 percent 
to 91.7 percent. It was 85 percent at the all-
India level. 
 The total area operated also 
declined from 68.24 lakh hectares in 

2005 Œ 06 to 64.88 lakh hectares in 

2010 Œ 11 (4.9%).  Of the total area 

operated in all India at 159.2 million 

hectares, Tamil Nadu accounted for 4 

percent. The average size of land holding in the St
ate further reduced from 0.83 hectare in 
2005-06 to 0.80 hectare in 2010-11.  The average si
ze of land holding at the all-India level 
was comparatively higher at 1.16 hectare.    
 Among the districts as per the Agriculture Census 2
010-11, the average size of land 
holding was in the range of 0.22 hectare in Kanniya
kumari to 2.00 hectare in Tiruppur.  Out of 
31 districts, in as many as 18 districts the averag
e size of holdings was below the State™s 
average (0.80 hectare). The small size of land hold
ings inhibits investment in productivity-
enhancing measures and makes many agricultural hold
ings sub-optimal.   
 The average size of large holdings at 20.58 hectare
s in Tamil Nadu  was  higher than 
the all-India average size 17.38 hectares.  In Tami
l Nadu, the average size of marginal

holdings at 0.37 hectare, small holdings at 1.39 he
ctare and medium holdings at 3.37 hectare 
were somewhat smaller than that of all-India at 0.3
8 hectare, 1.42 hectare and 3.60 hectare 
respectively.    
 Of the total land holdings in State, institutional 
holdings accounted for a meagre share 
of 0.24 percent and in the total operated area its 
share was 2.05 percent. Among the districts, 
the number of institutional holdings ranged between
 63 in Salem and 2,583 in 
Kanniyakumari.   
 4.4. Performance of Principal Crops: 
 Achieving food security by increasing agricultural 
production forms the core of 
agricultural development strategy in the State. Thi
s policy assumes greater significance with 
the increasing population and accelerating economic
 growth.  A number of programmes have 
been launched for increasing production of agricult
ural commodities in the State at different 
points of time.  Thanks to the favourable temporal 
and spatial spread of rainfall and adequate 
availability of water both in surface and sub-surfa
ce flow for irrigation, the production of 
principal crops in the State witnessed increase  in
 2011-12 as compared to the previous year 
2010-11. The increase in production was mainly addu
ced to the increase in yield rate of 
crops rather than that of area.  In 2012-13, the si
tuation was entirely different.  The prolonged 
dry spell, the deficit rainfall during South-West M
onsoon, the uneven temporal spread during 
the North-East Monsoon and the decline in water ava
ilability in surface and sub-surface 
sources for irrigation produced adverse effect on c
ropped area and area irrigated.  On the 
other  hand, there was an increase in fallows cause
d by the wide spread drought.  The   area, 
yield and production of all crops in the State were
 affected during 2012-13.  The fall in yield 
was more pronounced than that of area.   
  During 2011-12, there was an all-time high producti
on of foodgrains at 101.52 lakh 
tonnes.  However, a wide spread drought during 2012
-13 triggered a steep decline in 
foodgrains production to 56.05 lakh tonnes (45.0%).
 The fall 
in the production of all constituents of foodgrains
 viz., rice, 
pulses and millets  caused the overall decline in f

production during 2012-13. Among them the fall in r
ice 
production was much pronounced. In the case of prod
uction 
of rice, it fell from 74.59 lakh tonnes in 2011-12 
to 40.50 lakh 
tonnes in 2012-13 (46.0%). It was mainly due to the
 fall in 
yield rate of rice rather than the drop in area. Th
e area under 
paddy declined by 22.0 percent and that of yield by
 31.0 
percent  between these two years.  The per hectare

of paddy (in terms of rice)  at  3,918 kgs during t
he year 2011-12 was the best. In 2012-13 it 
declined to 2,712 kgs.  However, the yield rate of 
the crop  also  varied  within  the  State  as 
well as among  the  seasons  significantly.  Across
 the State the yield rate of paddy ranged 
between 588 kgs per hectare in Ramanathapuram and 4
728 kgs per hectare in 
kanniyakumari districts in 2012-13.  Among the seas
ons, the normal yield (average for the 5 
years ending 2011-12) obtained at 3,799 kgs per hec
tare in Kar/Kuruvai/Sornavari season 
was the highest as compared to 2,913 kgs in 

Samba/Thaladi/Pisanam and 3,552 kgs in 

Navarai/Kodai.  In the light of limited scope for 

expanding area under cultivation and under irrigati
on, 
the only way to meet the growing food requirement, 
 is to 
narrow down the vast gap in the yield rate among th
e 
districts as well as between the seasons. This call
s for 
the need for renewed research effort to narrow down
 the 
yield gap.  In 2013-14, it is anticipated to cover 
18.49 
lakh hectares under paddy and to produce 57.26 lakh
 
tonnes of rice. 
 Coarse cereals comprise crops like jowar, cumbu, ra
gi, maize and other small millets 
(korra , varagu, samai) which have traditionally be
en the main components of the food 
basket. These crops are being grown predominantly i
n rainfed conditions. Changing 
consumption pattern, non-adoption of the recommende
d doses of inputs due to high risk 
under rainfed agro-climatic conditions, non-availab
ility of high yielding variety quality seeds 
particularly of small millets, lack of assured proc
urement and poor resource base of the 
farmers who largely grow these crops are the limiti
ng factors in increasing the area and 
production of coarse cereals.  The total millets pr
oduction in the State dwindled from 23.24 
lakh tonnes in 2011-12 to 13.42 lakh tonnes in 2012
-13 (42.3%).  Eventhough the area 
increased by 0.6 percent between these two years, t
he fall in yield rate by 43.0 percent 
caused on overall decline in millets production. Wi
th the increase in the coverage to 9.10 lakh 
hectares during 2013-14, the total production of co
arse cereals is likely to go up to 25.0 lakh 
tonnes. 
  Being rich in protein, pulses not only form a vital
 part of the human diet, but also play 
a crucial role in balancing the dietary proteins. T
he major pulse crops grown are green gram 
(24.6%), black gram (46.2%) and horse gram (10.3%) 
which accounted for 81.1 percent of 
the total area under pulses in the State in 2011-12
. Cultivation of pulses is mostly (89.4% of 
the area) under rainfed condition on marginal lands
 with less fertile soil by resource-poor 
farmers.  The wide spread drought also affected the
 area, yield and production of pulses 
during 2012-13.  The decline in area was 23.4 perce
nt 
and in yield was 25.1 percent.  This caused a fall 
in 
pulses production in the State from 3.69 lakh tonne
s in 
2011-12 to 2.13 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 (42.3%).  Th
e 
average yield rate of pulses in the State even at i
ts peak 
at 554 kgs per hectare during 2011-12 was short of 
the 
all India average 694 kgs per hectare.  The total a
rea 
under pulses is likely to go up to 7.73 lakh hectar
es in 
2013-14 and the anticipated production is 3.20 lakh
 
tonnes. Non- availability of high yielding varietie
s, low 
Seed Replacement Rate (SRR), high susceptibility to
 
pests are the primary reasons for low yield of puls
es. To 

attain higher levels in yield rates focus needs  ex
pansion in area under micro irrigation, more 
use of micro nutrients, adoption of improved produc
tion practices and evolving better yielding 
seeds.  
 Sugarcane is the most important cash crop in the 
State which is widely cultivated in irrigated condi
tions. 
Despite drought, the crop™s coverage did not suffer
 during 
2012-13.  In fact, it increased from 3.46 lakh hect
ares in 
2011-12 to 3.48 lakh hectares in 2012-13 (0.6%).  F
ixing of 
a higher State Advised Price (SAP) by the State 

Government at Rs.2,350/- per tonne linked to 9.5 pe
rcent 
recovery rate in 2012-13 as compared to that of 

Government of India™s Statutory Minimum Price of Rs
. 
1,700/- per tonne and the increase in area register
ed with 
sugar mills under the crop from 2.75 lakh hectares 
in 2011-12 to 2.81 lakh hectares in 2012-
13 were responsible for enlarging the crop™s covera
ge. Contrary to this trend, the yield rate 
fell from 113 tonnes per hectare in 2011-12 to 98 t
onnes per hectare in 2012-13.  The fall in 
yield rate was responsible for the decline in cane 
production from 389.75 lakh tonnes in 
2011-12 to 340.14 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 (12.7%).  
The recovery rate of cane also declined 
from 9.35 to 8.68 percent between these two years. 
 This underlines the need for evolving 
new varieties having more sugar content.  The cane 
production during 2013-14 is likely to be 
of the order of 375.5 lakh tonnes.   The State Gove
rnment has increased the State Advised 
Price to Rs.2,650/- per tonne this year.   
 Highly as volatile cotton prices and high cost of p
est 
control are the two major factors that limit the ex
pansion of 
area under cotton in the State.  The area under thi
s crop 
marginally fell from 1.36 lakh hectares in 2011-12 
to 1.33 
lakh hectares in 2012-13 (2.2%) and the yield rate 
(lint) from 
481 kgs to 326 kgs (32.2%). They triggered the decl
ine in 
production from 3.82 lakh bales to 2.55 lakh bales 
(33.2%) 
of cotton in the State. During 2013-14 the coverage
 under 
the crop would be 1.50 lakh hectares and that of pr
oduction 
3.18 lakh bales. Developing cotton varieties suitab
le for 
increasing yield, especially, under rainfed conditi
ons, continuous follow up of pest monitoring 
and advisory services are some of the issues meriti
ng serious attention to increase the 
production and productivity of cotton in the State.
  
 Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the State
 
on marginal lands, dependent on monsoons with low l
evel 
of input usage.  Of the total area cultivated under
 oilseeds 
edible oilseeds accounted for 99.0 percent and rest
 being 
non-edible oilseeds.  The prominent oilseeds raised
 were 
groundnut, gingelly, castor and sunflower.  The tem
poral 
and spatial spread of rainfall during the year 2012
-13 was 
not beneficial to raising of oilseeds. Consequently
, the total 
area cultivated under these crops and the average y
ield 
rate declined from 4.49 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to
 3.90 
lakh hectares in 2012-13 (13.1%) and from 2,481 kgs
 to 
2,092 kgs (15.7%) per hectare respectively. This br
ought about a fall in the overall production 
of oilseeds in the State from 11.14 lakh tonnes to 
8.16 lakh tonnes (26.8%) between these 

two years. During 2013-14 the production would be o
f the order of 10.35 lakh tonnes. The 
following measures are needed to improve the area, 
yield and production of oilseeds: i) 
minimizing the wide inter-district variations in th
e yield level by adopting suitable package of 
practices and ii) evolving hybrids/high yielding va
rieties having more oil content but at the 
same time weathering the natural calamities and pes
t and diseases attack.   
 4.5  Horticulture: 
 In the context of increasing population, swelling u
rbanization and a favourable shift in 
consumption of fruits and vegetables, there is a ne
ed for covering larger areas under 
horticulture crops. Horticulture crops in Tamil Nad
u account for nearly 17 percent of the total 
cropped area. There has been a steady increase in t
he area covered under horticulture crops 
in the recent past.  The total area covered under h
orticulture crops in the  State  moved up 
from 10.01 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 10.81 lakh h
ectares in 2012-13 (8.0%) and would  
further  rise to 11.46  lakh hectares in 2013-14 (6
.0%).  Fruits, vegetables, spices and 
condiments and plantation crops together claimed a 
share of 96.0 percent of the total area 
covered under horticultural crops. The overall yiel
d rate exhibited a steady improvement.  The 
average yield rate of horticultural crops per hecta
re improved from 15.24 tonnes in 2011-12 
to 16.09 tonnes in 2012-13 (5.6%)  and  would furth
er  improve to  16.69  tonnes   in 2013-14 
(3.7%). The increase in area and yield rate helped 
to augment the total production of 
horticultural crops from 152.62 lakh tonnes in 2011
-12 to 173.99 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 
(14.0%) and further to 191.31 lakh tonnes in 2013-1
4 (10.0%).
  During the Eleventh Five Year Plan, the State 
schemes viz., the Integrated Horticulture Developme
nt 
Schemes (IHDS) (Rs.28.59 crore), Integrated Tribal 

Development Programmes (ITDP) (Rs.2.0 crore), Weste
rn 
Ghats Development Programme (WGDP) and Hill Area 

Development Programme (HADP) (Rs. 12.40 crore) and 

National Agricultural Development Programme (NADP) 
(Rs. 
182.45 crore) were implemented.  The Centrally-Spon
sored 
Schemes like National Horticulture Mission (NHM) (R
s. 
479.01 crore), National Mission on Micro Irrigation
 (NMMI) 
(Rs. 256.01 crore), National Bamboo Mission (NBM) (
Rs. 
3.73 crore) and National Mission on Medicinal Plant
s (NMMP) (Rs. 27.30 crore) were also in 
operation.  The State also implemented the World Ba
nk assisted IAMWARM project (Rs. 72.0 
crore) for expansion of area with high value hortic
ultural crops in 61 sub-basins in Tamil 
Nadu.  Under precision farming, an extent of 22,294
 hectares was covered and 1,238

clusters were established during 2008-11.  During t
he Eleventh Five Year Plan period, an 
area of 91,130 hectares was brought under micro irr
igation. All these schemes have gone a 
long way towards enhancing the production of hortic
ultural crops. 
 Even though many schemes are being implemented for 
the promotion of horticulture 
crops, yet the following impediments are still at w
ork: i) the perishable nature limits the  extent 
of market and transaction opportunities; ii) prices
 are highly volatile due to seasonal 
conditions;  iii) inadequate and timely availabilit
y of pedigree planting materials; iv) period of 
waiting is significantly long for those seeking qui
ck return and v) lack of technical guidance for 
increasing the productivity per unit of area due to
 weak extension machinery.  
 4.6  Trend in Overall Agricultural Production:  
 Index of Agricultural Production is the summary mea
sure which shows the pulse of 
the performance in agricultural sector. In view of 
the fact that the performance of the 
agricultural sector displays wide variations from y
ear to year, the trends in area, yield and 
production are analyzed during the 10
th
 (2002-03 to 2006-07) and 11
th
 (2007-08 to 2011-12) 
Five Year Plan  periods.  
  The overall agricultural production in the State h
ad gone up at an annual average 
growth rate of 7.29 percent during the 10
th
 Five Year plan period (2002-2007).This 
accomplishment is mainly due to the increase in yie
ld rate of crops.  There was an overall 
decline in area by 0.42 percent in this period. Dur
ing this Plan period, the production of food 
crops fared better than non-food crops. Turning to 
11
th
 Five Year Plan period (2007-2012), 
the overall agricultural production in the State de
clined by an annual average rate of 2.37 
percent.  The fall both in area 

and yield rate of crops was 

mainly responsible for this 

decline during the 11
th
 Plan 
period.  As between food and 

non-food crops, even though the 

latter registered a growth of 0.33 

percent, the decline in the 
production of food crops by an annual average 3.08 
percent engendered the fall in the overall 
agricultural production in the State.  In the case 
of food crops, both area and yield rate 
witnessed negative growth in this Plan period.  In 
respect of non-food crops, only the area 
under the crops registered a fall and the increase 
in yield rate of crops compensated the fall 
in area and contributed to the overall increase in 
production.  
 4.7  Yield Gap: 
 The yield gap is also a major issue 
that contributes to agricultural stagnation in 

the State.  There is considerable yield gap 

between on-farm trials and yield actually 

realized by the farmers.  Except paddy, 

there is significant yield gap in other crops.  

The yield gap is around 50.0 percent of the 

potential yield. This is because the 

adoption of agronomic practices has not 

been uniform and widespread. Agricultural

strategy has to focus attention towards bridging th
e gap between the potential yield and the 
actual yield realized.    
 4.8  Self-Reliance in Production: 
 The ICMR had estimated the per capita 
per day nutritional requirement of rice at 370 

grams and pulses at 70 grams.  Based on 

these norms the total requirement of these 

agricultural commodities for 2013-14 was 

worked out.  A comparison was made with the 

total estimated requirement and production.  

There was a shortfall between the requirement and t
he estimated production level of rice and 
pulses.  The gap was particularly significant in re
spect of pulses and illustrates that self 
sufficiency in food production in Tamil Nadu is som
e way off.     
 4.9  Loss of Agricultural Production due to Natural
 calamities:
  
  During 2011-12, a cyclone caused extensive damages
 to paddy, millets, pulses, 
sugarcane, groundnut and coconut in the districts o
f Cuddalore, Villupuram, Thanjavur, 
Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur, Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur
, Dharmapuri and Thiruvannamalai 
during the fag end of the North-East Monsoon period
. The total area affected was 1.88 lakh 
hectares and the total value of production loss amo
unted to Rs. 968.73 crore.  The relief 
measures were sanctioned to the level of Rs.174.24 
crore benefiting 2.91 lakh farmers.   
     Coupled with the prolonged dry 

spell since January 2012, the deficit 

rainfall during the South-West Monsoon 

and the uneven temporal and spatial 

spread of rainfall during the North-East 

Monsoon caused widespread drought in 

the State during 2012-13. The State 

Government declared 31 districts of Tamil 

Nadu except Chennai as drought affected 

and sanctioned various relief  measures  

to mitigate the sufferings of the farmers. In 

overall terms the total area and production 

affected by drought in the State during the 

year was estimated at 10.01 lakh hectares 

and 32.42 lakh tonnes respectively. The 

total value of loss of crop production was 

estimated at Rs. 3475.45 crore in the State. On an 
average, the loss of crop production per 
hectare worked out to Rs.34,719. In the case of foo
d crops, the total area affected by drought 
was 8.68 lakh hectares (86.7%) and production was 2
0.90 lakh tonnes (64.5%).  The total 
estimated value of loss of foodcrop production was 
Rs. 2770 crore (79.7%).  The total area 
affected under non food crops was 1.33 lakh hectare
s (13.3%).  The quantum of production 
under non-food crops affected by drought in the Sta
te was 11.52 lakh tonnes (35.5%) and the 
estimated loss of value was Rs.705 crore (20.3%). T
he State had sanctioned relief measures 
to the tune of Rs. 1,143 crore benefiting 20.33 lak
h farmers.  Of the total farmers benefited, 
those raising food crops accounted for 89.0 percent
 and the rest of the 11.0 percent were 
non-food crops cultivators.

4.10  Input Management: 
 Crop production is essentially a function of the in
terplay of natural resources such as 
land, water, soil, biodiversity with the plant gene
tic material i.e. use of quality seeds and use 
of other agricultural inputs like chemical fertiliz
ers, organic manure, pesticides, farm 
machinery and equipment, labour, credit and insuran
ce, pricing policy and marketing 
infrastructure. This section highlights the present
 status regarding the availability and access 
of agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pes
ticides, and credit which determine agricultural 
productivity and production.  
 4.10.1 Irrigation: 
  The annual per capita water availability in India 
is about 2200m
3 
whereas it is only 
about 750 m
3 
in Tamil Nadu. There are about 81 reservoirs, 41,12
7 tanks and 18.21 lakh 
wells in the State.  The total storage capacity of 

15 major reservoirs in the State is 198.38 tmcft.  

Against which water realization stood at 172.26 

tmcft in 2011-12 (86.8%).  Due to wide spread 

drought, water realization in the reservoirs in 

the State was restricted to 89.8 tmcft  in 2012-

13 (45.3%).  The decline in ground water table 

across the State is a matter of serious concern.  

As a result, out of 386 blocks in the State, 139 

blocks are categorized as over-exploited, 33 

blocks as critical, 67 blocks as semi-critical, 11 

blocks as poor quality and the balance 136 

blocks as safe.   
 The total net area irrigated in the State 
by all sources of irrigation declined from 29.64 

lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 26.43 lakh hectares 

in 2012-13 (10.8%).  There was a fall in gross 

area irrigated from 35.19 lakh hectares to 29.91 

lakh hectares (15.0%).  Canals accounted for 
22.0 percent, tanks for 16.0 percent and wells for 
62.0 percent. Eventhough the drought had 
its adverse effect on net area irrigated by differe
nt sources, it was more pronounced in the 
case of surface flow sources.  

It was 20.4 percent in the 

case of tanks and 20.9 

percent in respect of canals. 

The fall in net area irrigated 

by wells during 2012-13 was 

3.4 percent as compared to 

2011-12. The irrigation 

intensity in the State declined 

from 119.0 percent in 2011-12 

to 113.2 percent in 2012-13.   
 Water demand is increasing rapidly due to populatio
n growth, urbanization and 
changing lifestyle. Owing to increasing demand of w
ater for domestic, industrial and energy 
uses, there is a severe constraint in the availabil
ity of water for agriculture. Climate change

Chennai-6. 

might complicate further the existing temporal and 
spatial variation in availability of water. 
Extreme events like floods and droughts are occurri
ng more frequently and affecting 
livelihood and food security. Low water use efficie
ncy and inadequate maintenance of 
irrigation systems are some of the major problems t
hat confront the management of water 
resources in the State. There is a need to promote 
participatory management of aquifers to 
ensure sustainable and equitable use of water. Prom
otion of micro-irrigation techniques, 
alignment of cropping patterns with the availabilit
y of water and greater involvement and 
empowerment of Water Users™ Associations in the com
mand areas could lead to 
improvement in water use efficiency.   
 With a view to improve the service delivery of the 
irrigation system and to increase the 
productivity with effective integrated water resour
ces management in a sub-basin frame work, 
a multi-sector  project Irrigated Agriculture Moder
nization and Water Bodies Restoration and 
Management Project (IAMWARM) with financial assista
nce of World Bank is being 
implemented in the State .  Between 2007-08 and 201
3-14, project rehabilitation works in 
4,549 tanks, 655 anaicuts and 8,018 k.m length of s
upply channels had been completed to 
benefit 6.69 lakh hectares with an expenditure of R
s.1,284 crores.  With the financial 
assistance of the Central and State Governments (50
:50), the Command Area Development 
Programme is currently being implemented in the Sta
te in Vaigai reservoir, Kodadanar 
reservoir, Varadhamanadhi reservoir, Kalingarayan a
naicut, Pelandurai anaicut, Cheyyur 
anaicut, Ellis anaicut and Manimutharu nadhi system
.  During 2012-13, on-farm development 
works were carried out to benefit 18,262 hectares a
t a cost of Rs.27.95 crore and Rotational 
Water Supply to benefit 18,267 hectares at a cost o
f Rs.0.60 crore. In 2013-14, on-farm 
development works are to be taken up to benefit an 
extent of area of 4,778 hectares at a total 
cost of Rs.38.83 crore under this programme.  Rotat
ional Water Supply works are also to be 
taken up to benefit 3,213 hectares at a cost of Rs.
0.78 crores. 
  Rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation str
uctures is taken up under the 
National Agriculture Development Programme.  For 20
12-13, out of 14 works accorded 
sanction at a cost of Rs. 9.21 crore, 7 works were 
completed.  The 13
th
 Finance Commission 
had recommended a grant of Rs. 200 crores for resto
ration of 674 traditional water bodies 
over a period of four years since 2011-12. During 2
012-13, 175 works were taken up at a 
cost Rs. 50 crore.  The Government has taken initia
tives to replenish the ground water 
potential through rain water harvesting and recharg
e structures.  Under Master Plan Artificial 
Recharge Scheme, the State had sanctioned Rs.550 cr
ores towards restoring the depleted 
aquifers through construction of check dams across 
rivers, streams, percolation ponds and 
recharge shafts.  Under the scheme, as against the 
target of 523 works, 429 works were 
completed at a total cost of Rs.199.66 crore up to 
2012-13.  The remaining 94 works at a cost 
of Rs. 65.45 crore are being taken up during the ye
ar 2013-14.  Under various schemes, 82 
percolation ponds at a cost of Rs.4.55 crore and fa
rm ponds numbering 320 were created at 
a cost of Rs.2.05 crore.   
 4.10.2 Seeds:    
 Quality seeds and planting materials are key 
agricultural inputs, which determine the productivi
ty of 
crops.  It is estimated that the quality of seed ac
counts 
for 20-25 percent of productivity. As a result of t
he 
adverse weather conditions, the quantum of supply o
f 
seeds in the State declined from 99,390 tonnes in 2
011-
12 to 73,033 tonnes in 2012-13.  In 2013-14 ( upto 
Feb 

2014), the supply of seeds  is 84,530 tonnes.  Howe
ver, as against the total estimated 
requirements, there was a persistent short fall in 
the supply of seeds by the organized sector 
(public and private) in the State. The short fall w
as conspicuous in respect of pulses, oil 
seeds and millets.  The organized sector had met on
ly 43 to 45 percent of the total seed 
requirements in the State. A larger portion of seed
 requirement i.e. about 57 to 55 percent 
continues to be met from the unorganized sector i.e
., mainly farm-saved seeds. Of the total 
quantum of seeds distributed by the organized secto
r during 2012-13, paddy alone 
accounted for 78.0 percent.  As against the stipula
ted seed replacement rate of 33.0 percent 
in respect of paddy, pulses and oilseeds and 50.0 p
ercent  for millets and cotton,  the actual 
rate fell short of in the case of pulses and oilsee
ds.  
 There is a need to develop better varieties/hybrids
/planting materials, which will be 
able to manifest itself even under challenging agro
-climatic conditions. The provision of 
subsidy for seeds for newer and older varieties nee
ds to be rationalized. The time is right to 
prepare a long term Seed Plan for the State keeping
 in mind the agro-climatic conditions, 
farmers™ requirements, SRR of the crops, State™s cr
op calendar and any contingent situations 
that may arise in order to ensure availability of q
uality seed at the right time to the farmers. In 
the absence of such a seed plan, farmers are forced
 to fall back on ‚farm-saved™ seeds or 
Truthfully Labelled Seeds.  Steps need to be taken 
to prepare a Seed Plan for 5 years. Seed 
Replacement needs the serious attention it deserves
.  
 4.10.3 Integrated Nutrient Management:
  
 Chemical fertilizers are the immediate source of nu
trients in the soils. In the State, a 
total number of 11,780 retail outlets effect fertil
izer distribution of which private retail outlets 
accounted for 63.0 percent and the rest being co-op
erative outlets. With the decline in 
cropped area as well as irrigated area consequent t
o the widespread drought, the total 
consumption of nitrogenous (N), 

phosphatic (P), potassic (K) fertilizers in 

the State declined to 13.74 lakh tonnes in 

2012-13 from 18.13 lakh tonnes in 2011-

12.  Eventhough, the three constituents 

witnessed a shortfall during 2012-13, it was 

much sharper in phosphatic (P) and 

potassic (K). In 2013-14, with the normal 

monsoon and increase in cropped as well 
as irrigated area, the total fertilizer consumption
 in the State would likely to go up to 13.88 
lakh tonnes.   
 The consumption of NPK in the State is found to be 
in the ratio of 4:1:1 in 2012-13 as 
against the conventionally accepted ratio of 4:2:1 
indicating imbalances in the application of 
three chemical nutrients.  Continuation of subsidy 
on urea while decontrolling phosphate and

potash fertilizers further adds to the inadvertent 
promotion of imbalance in fertilizer use on the 
one hand and excessive use of nitrogenous fertilize
r on 
the other hand, leading to environmental pollution 
and 
lowering of profits to the farmers. The crop- wise 

consumption revealed that    paddy alone accounted 
for 
more than 50 percent of the total fertilizer consum
ption in 
the State.   
The average per hectare 
fertilizer consumption in the State 

declined from 438 kgs in 2011-12 

to 235 kgs in 2012-13.  In 2013-

14, it is expected to be  of the 

order of 308 kgs.  The all-India 

average consumption of fertilizers 

remained stable at 144 kgs per 

ha in 2011-12 when compared to 

the previous year. Very high 

variability was observed in 

fertilizer consumption among the 

districts.  Across the State, it was 

the highest in Madurai (669 Kgs) 

and lowest in Tiruppur (7 kg) 

districts in 2012-13.   
 The major constraints for adopting rational crop nu
trition schedules are (a) high cost
 of straight fertilizers of nutrients other than NPK
 and Zinc; (b) lack of strong policy support 
from the Government of India for balanced fertilize
r use and (c) lack of awareness among the 
farmers. 
 The Government is strictly monitoring the quality o
f the fertilizers through 14 Fertilizer 
Control Laboratories.  During 2012-13, a total of 1
6,540 samples were tested of which 436 
samples were found sub-standard.  It was programmed
 to analyze 17,500 fertilizer samples 
during 2013-14.   
  
 Micro nutrients are best applied through 

fortification of major fertilizers.  They have a 

significant impact on plant growth and life.  A 

total quantity of  1,626 tonnes of micro nutrients 

were produced in 2012-13 and  1,392 tonnes 

were supplied.  In 2013-14, it was programmed 

to produce 1,600 tonnes and to distribute entire 

quantity.  The crop -wise micro nutrient 

distribution during 2012-13 reveals that paddy 

accounted for 68.3 percent followed by coconut 

(10.6%), groundnut (6.6%) cotton and millets 

(4.4% each) and pulses (3.4%) and the rest being ot
her crops.

A total quantity of 2,380 tonnes of bio-fertilizers
 was produced from the 15 centres out 
of which 2,180 tonnes were distributed to cover 4.8
8 lakh hectares benefitting 3.45 lakh 
farmers in 2012-13. In 2013-14, it is proposed to p
roduce and distribute 3,850 tonnes of bio-
fertilizers in the State.  
 Comprehensive and authentic database on micro nutri
ent/bio- fertilizer production and 
distribution in the State by public and private sec
tors needs to be built up for the benefit of all 
the stakeholders. With a view to ensure availabilit
y of true to type of micro nutrient/bio 
fertilizers to farmers; to curb sale of spurious an
d poor quality produce; to protect the rights of 
farmers; and to increase private participation in p
roduction and distribution, quality control 
needs to be enforced with utmost urgency on par wit
h international standards. 
 4.10.4 Integrated Pest Management: 
  The protection of crops from predations of pests a
nd diseases is a sine qua non for 
higher agricultural productivity, increased farm in
comes and enhanced food security for the 
nation.  Anecdotal evidence revealed that there is 
a production loss up to 30 percent due to 
incursion of pests and diseases. With the primary o
bjective of reducing the use of harmful 
pesticides and integrating as many non-chemical met
hods, Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) has been implemented in a cost-effective mann
er since late 1980s in the State.  It 
emphasizes promoting eco-friendly, bio-pesticide te
chnology at the field level.  Consequent to 
the implementation of IPM Technology and the fall i
n area cultivated, the technical grade 
material consumption in the State which was 10,926 
tonnes in 1984-85 drastically come 
down to 2,261 tonnes in 2011-12 and further to 2,20
7 tonnes in 2012-13.  Between these two 
years it is noteworthy that use of chemical pestici
des in the State declined from 385 grams 
per hectare to 375 grams per hectare.  Compared to 
the global average of 500 grams of 
technical grade pesticide per hectare it was on the
 low side.  The chemical pesticides are 
sold through 11,093 retail outlets of which 89.0 pe
rcent were in the private sector, 8.0 percent 
in the Government sector and 3.0 percent co-operati
ves.  Consequent to the decline in area 
cropped due to widespread drought, the total area t
reated under various plant protection 
measures had come down to 35.72 lakh hectares in 20
12-13 as against 38.30 lakh hectares 
in the previous year.  Of the total area treated, p
addy accounted for 42.0 percent followed by 
millets (19.0%), pulses (15.0%), sugarcane and grou
ndnut (10.0% each) and cotton (4.0%).    
 Certain special initiatives that can be taken up fo
r the effective implementation of IPM 
so as to produce safe and clean agricultural produc
e in a cost effective manner include: (a) 
training farmers on IPM Technology and educating th
em about the ill effects of indiscriminate 
use of pesticides; (b) encouraging the private sect
or to produce bio-pesticides; (c) regulating 
the sale of chemical pesticides and preventing misu
se; (d) developing indigenous and cost 
effective pheromones; and (e) ensuring availability
 of critical inputs  in right time.   
 4.10.5 Crop Insurance:  
 With a view to insulate the 
farmers against the loss occurred due 

to natural calamities, large scale 

outbreak of pests and diseases and 

to ensure credit worthiness for  the 

ensuing season,  the Agricultural  

Insurance Company of  India Limited   

implements  the National  Agricultural Insurance Sc
heme in the State.  The unit of insurance 
under the scheme is block depending on the area und
er the crop notified.  Under the

scheme, the total number of farmers insured their c
rops in the State increased from 4.89 
lakhs in 2011-12 to 10.83 lakhs in 2012-13.   The t
otal area insured under the scheme had 
gone up from 7.03 lakh hectares in 2011-12 to 12.35
 lakh hectares in 2012-13 with the total 
sum insured at Rs.1,686 crores and Rs.3,402 crores 
respectively.  In 2013-14 (up to 
October), 0.15 lakh hectares were insured for a sum
 Rs.46 crores.  Of the total area covered, 
paddy, banana, black gram, sugarcane and maize toge
ther accounted for more than 90  
percent  in both  the years.  Claims to the tune of
 Rs.40 crore were paid to benefit 0.42 lakh 
farmers in 2011-12 and Rs. 744 crore to 5.57 lakh f
armers in 2012-13.  Research to evolve 
location specific insurance products and enhancing 
insurance education for the small and 
marginal farmers is the need of the hour.    
 The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme stipulat
es the premium level of 2.0 
percent to 3.5 percent of the sum insured.  Of this
, the State has extended 50 percent 
premium subsidy enabling the farmers only to pay 1.
0 percent to 1.75 percent of the sum 
insured. The Government of India has introduced a n
ew National Crop Insurance Scheme 
(NCIS) with two components ﬁModified National Agric
ultural Insurance Schemeﬂ and 
ﬁWeather Based Crop Insurance Schemeﬂ from Rabi 201
3-14 onwards by withdrawing  the 
National Agricultural Insurance Scheme. Under the n
ew Modified National Agricultural 
Insurance Scheme which is implemented in all distri
cts from Rabi 2013-14, the premium 
payable by the farmers increases to 3.75 percent.  
With a view to encourage the farmers to 
adopt the agricultural crop insurance on a large sc
ale so as to enable them to mitigate the 
crop losses and continue their agricultural operati
ons in a sustainable manner, the State 
Government has made a strong plea to the Central Go
vernment to equally share the 
increased commitment on premium for the farmers ove
r and above 2.0 percent of the sum 
insured.   
 4.10.6 Institutional Credit: 
  Timely availability of credit 
at reasonable rates especially to 

small and marginal farmers is 

crucial for agricultural growth.  

Public sector banks, co-operative 

banks and regional rural banks 

play an important role in meeting 

the entire crop loans needs in the 

State.  Of the total credit disbursed 

by the above institutions, the share 

of the farm sector increased from 

53.7 percent in 2011-12 to 60.3 

percent in 2012-13. The quantum 

of crop loan disbursed in the State 

by these institutions steadily increased from Rs. 3
4,432 crore in 2011-12 to Rs. 51,991 crore 
in 2012-13 (51.0%).  It was planned to disburse cro
p loans to the tune of Rs. 48,657 crores in 
2013-14.  Of the total crop loan disbursed, paddy, 
plantation and horticulture crops together 
accounted for a sizable share of about 72.0 percent
 in both the years.  During 2012-13 in 
respect of paddy, oil seeds, turmeric, sugarcane an
d plantation and horticulture crops the 
disbursement of crop credit exceeded the respective
 targets. 
 A meagre 4.0 percent of the total institutional cre
dit for the farm sector had been 
utilized for infrastructure development viz., minor
 irrigation (Rs. 859 crore), land development

(Rs.404 crore), farm mechanization (Rs.1,119 crore)
 and storage/market yard (Rs. 190 crore) 
in 2012-13.   
 Vast extent of agricultural lands is given on lease
 for small and marginal 
farmers/agricultural labourers due to migration of 
land owners, labour problems and other 
reasons.  These tenant farmers are not able to secu
re credit from banks and have to depend 
on informal sources of credit for taking up cultiva
tion.  There is need for bringing them into 
banking fold and facilitate provision of credit for
 farming operations.   
 4.10.7 Agriculture Marketing: 
 Owing to a number of factors such as inadequate sto
rage facilities, lack of quick and 
economical means of transportation, perishability o
f farm produce, poor withholding capacity 
of the farmers and urgent credit needs, the unorgan
ized sector comprising wholesale 
merchants, commission agents and other intermediari
es continue to dominate the sphere of 
agricultural marketing in the State.  With the 

aim to create infrastructure and to regulate 

agricultural produce trade activities, the State 

Government enacted the Tamil Nadu 

Agricultural Marketing (Regulation) Act 1987 

and Rules 1991 replacing the earlier Act of 

1959.   At present, 21 Marketing Committees 

are functioning at the district level.  Under their
 
control, 277 Regulated Markets are functioning 

in the State. Among them 66.0 percent 
transacted business of 5,000 metric tonnes per annu
m, 18.0 percent 2,000 to 5,000 mt of 
produce and 16.0 percent less than 2,000 mt per ann
um. The total number of licensed 
traders engaged in the transaction of agricultural 
produce in the regulated markets increased 
from 27,620 in 2011-12 to 28,253 in 2012-13.   Due 
to the wide spread drought, the total 
quantum of agricultural produce transacted in the r
egulated markets fell from 18.97 lakh 
tonnes in 2011-12 to 17.43 lakh tonnes in 2012-13. 
 With the prevailing favourable 
agricultural scenario in the State during 2013-14, 
it was programmed to transact 27.30 lakh 
tonnes.  The total value of agricultural commoditie
s transacted by these regulated markets 
during 2012-13 was Rs.3, 116 crore, of which food c
rops accounted for a major share of 68.0 
percent and the remaining being non-food crops.  Up
to the end of October 2013, the total 
value of transactions stood at Rs. 1,508 crore.  
  Grading of agricultural commodities has three main
 purposes, namely, (a) to promote 
common trade language and avoid the need for physic
al checking and handling at many 
points; (b) to protect consumers by ensuring qualit
y of product purchases; and (c) to protect 
the producer from exploitation by ensuring prices c
ommensurate to the quality of produce. 
Total quantum of agricultural produce graded in the
 State increased from 2.59 lakh tonnes in 
2011-12 to 3.0 lakh tonnes in 2012-13.   
 Market information is an important tool in the agri
cultural marketing system. 189 
regulated markets upload prevailing agricultural pr
oduce price and arrivals on an electronic 
portal on a daily basis.  Apart from this, 179 farm
ers™ markets had also disseminated price 
details.  To minimize the loss after harvest during
 drying, cleaning and winnowing, 1,359 
village level drying yards were constructed at a to
tal cost of Rs. 27.35 crore.   Four Agri 
Export Zones were established in the PPP mode at Ho
sur, Ooty, Nilakottai and Panruti to 
facilitate value addition for agricultural products
 and to minimize post-harvest losses. It 
ensures steady and better price  realization  to th
e farming community as well as availability

of commodities in processed  form  to the  consumer
s throughout the year.   The total 
turnover of these zones during 2012-13 was Rs. 3.01
 crore.  
 In the co-operative fold, 110 Primary Co-
operative Marketing Societies transacted 

agricultural produce of a total value of Rs.552 

crore in 2012-13.  Up to October 2013, the total 

value of transaction was Rs. 163 crore.  Of the 

total value of transaction cotton alone accounted 

for a sizable share of 44.0 percent.  
 Food and agricultural commodity prices are 
primarily determined by domestic demand and 

supply factors.  Consequently, there is a wide gap 

between the prices received by the farmers and 

the prices paid by the consumer. At times, the farm
ers are not able to receive a price to cover 
the cost of production while the consumers are payi
ng an abnormally high price for the same 
commodity. This is a major concern for the policy m
akers. High food inflation with an 
inadequate supply response, aggravated by logistics
 and market-related constraints are other 
areas requiring attention. Further, to provide a hi
gher share of consumer prices to the 
farmers, there is a need to reduce the multiple lay
ers of intermediaries by providing 
alternative marketing channels.  Creation of scient
ific storages nearer to the farms is 
necessary so as to avoid wastage and produce deteri
oration. Enlarging the scope of 
provision of institutional credit to the farmers th
rough various instruments like pledge 
financing, so that they are not compelled to sell t
he produce at distress price is also 
necessary.  Supply of market information and extens
ion services to advise farmers on 
marketing, capacity-building in marketing; developm
ent of marketing linkages between 
farmers, agribusinesses and large retailers may be 
developed through cooperatives, contract 
farming or associations of stakeholders representin
g different interest groups like farmers, 
input suppliers, agricultural produce processers, e
tc.  
 4.11. Highlights of Major Schemes Implemented in th
e State: 
 The State has taken all efforts to increase agricul
tural production, enhance 
productivity and explore the untapped potential.  T
he Central Government also supplements 
the efforts of the State through implementation of 
Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector 
Schemes.    
 Development of wasteland/degraded land and improvin
g rainfed farming is crucial 
towards attaining self sufficiency in crop producti
on.  Towards achieving this goal, various 
area and location specific programmes viz., Drought
 Prone Area Programme (DPAP), 
Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP), 
Integrated Watershed Management 
Programme (IWMP), National Watershed Development Pr
oject for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA) 
are being implemented in the State over a period of
 time on watershed basis with the 
participatory approach. During 2012-13, the total a
rea treated under these programmes was 
1.47 lakh hectares at a cost of Rs. 186.13 crores. 
    With a view to improve the yield rate and product
ion of rice,  System of Rice 
Intensification (SRI) is being implemented in the S
tate.  During 2012-13, it had  adopted  the 
whole  village  concept in 1,719  villages covering
 an area of 1.68 lakh  hectares.  During 
2013-14, the scheme would be implemented in 2,000 v
illages covering an area of 1.90 lakh 
hectares.

To enhance the production of rice and pulses on mis
sion mode approach, the 
National Food Security Mission (NFSM) is implemente
d since 2007-08.  Under the scheme 
Rs.22.87 crores was spent during 2012-13 towards pr
omotion of rice in five districts viz., 
Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Sivagangai, Pudukkottai a
nd Ramanathapuram. Under this 
programme,  it was contemplated to improve pulses p
roduction in all districts except Chennai 
and The Nilgiris.  Various activities were taken up
 at a cost of Rs. 14.76 crores.   
 With the aim to increase productivity of oilseeds, 
pulses, oil palm and maize, the 
Integrated Scheme for Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil palm an
d Maize (ISOPOM) is implemented since 
2004-05 with region specific strategies.  From 2010
-11 onwards, since pulses have been 
integrated with the NFSM, ISOPOM scheme was  implem
ented only for oilseeds, oil palm 
and maize at a cost of Rs.18.51 crores  during 2012
-13.   
 Under National Mission on Micro Irrigation, instill
ation of sprinkler irrigation for 
sugarcane, cotton, maize, pulses, groundnut and hor
ticultural crops is taken up.  During 
2012-13 this scheme has been implemented by Tamil N
adu Horticulture Development 
Agency (TANHODA) at a cost of Rs. 135.34 crores ben
efiting an area of 26,538 hectares.  It 
has been proposed to cover 47,800 hectare at an out
lay of Rs. 372.84 crores in 2013-14.  
Under the World Bank aided programme IAMWARM, crop 
demonstration, distribution of 
agricultural implements, farmers training and capac
ity building are being taken up at an 
outlay of Rs. 98.00 crore.  The total expenditure i
ncurred upto 2012-13 was Rs. 81.27 crores.  
   
With the success in achieving an increase of 30 Œ 5
0 percent in productivity due to 
adoption of high yielding/hybrid seeds, micro irrig
ation and fertigation in vegetables, turmeric, 
banana, precision farming is successfully implement
ed from 2008 onwards.  During 2012-13, 
at 50 percent subsidy, it was implemented at a cost
 of Rs. 9.25 crore benefiting 4,961 
hectares.   
 For promotion of horticulture in rainfed area, Rain
fed Area Development Programme 
(RADP) was implemented in 2,655 acres at a cost of 
Rs. 8.79 crores during 2012-13.  
  
Towards augmenting mechanization in agriculture und
er National Agricultural 
Development Programme (NADP) subsidy assistance to 
individual farmers for purchasing 
agricultural machinery so as to take up timely sowi
ng, transplanting, weeding, plant protection 
and harvesting and to overcome the acute farm worke
rs scarcity during 2012-13 total subsidy 
assistance of Rs. 73.45 crore was provided to the f
armers for purchasing 41,328 machineries 
for agriculture purposes.     
   
4.12. A Way Forward:  
  To meet the growing demand for agricultural produce
 and to ensure food security, the 
following measures are proposed:-  
  For achieving a farm output growth of 5 percent, i
ncremental productivity gains and 
technology diffusion are imperative.   
 Agriculture growth targeted in the Five Year Plans
 has often not been achieved due to 
high degree of uncertainty of the monsoon.  In this
 context, dry land farming, crop 
diversification and conservation of water through p
recision farming and waste land 
development are indispensible.   
 For nutritional security, special thrust is requir
ed for higher production and productivity 
level in pulses, oilseeds and fruits and vegetables
.  
 Sufficient public sector investment in agriculture
 sector is central to agricultural planning.  

 Ground water is still perceived as individual prop
erty and is exploited inequitably and 
without any consideration to sustainability.  It le
ads to over exploitation.  This needs to be 
properly regulated.   
 Existing resource infrastructure is not 
being properly maintained resulting in 

under utilization of available resources. 

Maintenance of existing water bodies 

may be assigned top most priority. Local 

bodies as well as stakeholders should be 

involved in the process.    
 Encroachment and diversion of water 
bodies must not be allowed and 

wherever it has taken place it should be 

restored to the extent feasible.   
 Water Users Associations should be 
given statutory power to collect and 

retain a portion of water charges and 

maintain the distribution system in their 

jurisdiction.    
 A higher proportion of farmers rely on farm-saved 
seeds leading to low seed replacement 
rate.  It is desirable to achieve the required and 
recommended seed replacement rate to 
accomplish higher production and productivity. 
 There is skewness in the application of chemical f
ertilizers (NPK).  There is overdose of 
nitrogenous and limited doses of phosphotic and pot
ash fertilizers application.  Farmers 
are to be educated enough to apply balanced applica
tion of fertilizers.  It required 
appropriate price incentives.   
 Cost-effective and productivity-enhancing System o
f Rice Intensification is to be 
implemented with efficacy and pragmatism. 
 Reforms in extension services are needed to ensure
 smooth transfer of agriculture 
technology and information to the farming communiti
es.    
 Exhaustion of yield potential of high yielding var
ieties in rice is to be overcome. 
 Post harvest value addition is to be improved and 
upgraded with adequate public 
investment.   
 Efficient markets with a dynamic supply chain is i
ndispensable for the development of the 
agricultural sector.   
 With respect to horticulture, marketing initiative
s are to be taken to promote modern 
terminal markets for fruits, vegetable and other pe
rishables in the important urban 
centres. The terminal markets will operate on a hub
-and-spoke format wherein the 
terminal markets are linked to a number of collecti
on centres located in key production 
centres to allow easy access to farmers for marketi
ng of their produce. 
 There are wide yield gaps across the State.  Agric
ulture production can be substantially 
increased if the yield gap will be addressed proper
ly through technological and policy 
intervention.   
 Awareness on crop insurance among the farmers may 
be enhanced.  
 To sum up, agriculture development is predicated by
 improvement in farm production 
and productivity, better utilization of agriculture
 inputs, proper marketing infrastructure and 
support, stepping up of investment in agriculture w
ith due regard and environmental concerns 
and efficient food management.   

  Strategies of Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 
 The Tamil Nadu Vision 2023 has a three pronged stra
tegies 
for improving productivity and thereby sustaining g
rowth in 
agriculture production so as to meet the growing de
mand for 
the agricultural produce and as well as ensuring fo
od security.  
The Strategies are: 
· Improving productivity by introducing scientific 

agricultural methods and building an institutional 

network to support the continued adoption of the sa
me. 
· Ensuring timely irrigation by intelligent use of ava
ilable 
water by adopting effective recharging mechanisms, 

drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, timely cleaning 
and 
deepening of tanks and canals, and adopting 

appropriate cropping pattern based on water 

availability. 
· Developing suitable post harvest infrastructure to 

maximize the benefits of value addition and timely 

marketing of produce.  The State will also extend 

agricultural extension activities to cover the enti
re 
farming community.

efficiency analysis in Indian agriculture, little has been done on the
investigation of intra and interecological variations, size differences and
their interactions. However, ecological issues have paramount implications for
the low-input sustainable agricultural production. Furthermore, due to the
various causes of efficiency, the age-old size-based debate on efficiency
differences is not yet resolved. The present study examines the level of
technical efficiency across ecological zones and farm size groups in paddy
farms of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study showed that 90% of
the variation in output among paddy (IR-20) farms in the state is due to
differences in technical efficiency. Land, animal power and fertilisers have
significant influence on the level of paddy production. Varying from 0.59 to
0.97, the mean technical efficiency was found to be 0.83. The use of _F_-test
in two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and censored regression (Tobit model),
with dummies for ecological zones, farm size groups and their interactions,
has shown that, at mean level, the level of technical efficiency among paddy
farms of the state differs significantly across agro- ecological zones and
size groups as well. The study further indicated that small-sized paddy farms
in zone II and medium-sized paddy farms in zone III are represented by
ecologically size-biased production techniques; thus achieving higher
technical efficiency. * * * open in overlay Corresponding author. Tel.:

42development in agriculture, `40,000 crore has been proposed in the Vision Tamil Nadu 
2023.Tamil Nadu performs well  in the all India scenario in productivity of major 
food crops.  It ranked (2009-10) second 
in productivity of rice next to Punjab. 
(Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2011, 



case of maize and oilseeds productivity.  The 


productivity surpassing Karnataka and 

Gujarat.  Similarly, in productivity of 

sugarcane, it is the Numero Uno State and 

its productivity is nearly 45 percent more 
than the National average.  In the case of 

vegetables and fruits productivity, it ranked 



level.The issues and challenges of 
the agricultural sector is complex. The 

productivity has stagnated in the recent years 


b) depleting water resources, c) escalating 

inputs costs, d) increased incidence of 



health as a consequence of indiscriminate 

use of chemical inputs, f) low level of post 
harvest technology, g) uncertain market 

prospects, and h) relatively higher incidence 

of indebtedness of farmers (Swaminathan, 
2010). In addition to the above, marginalization 
of land holdings, high variability in rainfall 

distribution, pressure of expanding habitat 

intruding into farm space, inadequate capital 

formation by the public sector and declining 
public investment in agriculture affect the 

agricultural performance in the State.  Salient Features of AgricultureThe salient features of Tamil Nadu's 




present concentration of cultivation from 

water intensive crops like rice and sugarcane 

to more nutritious but less water consuming 

crops like pulses, millets, oilseeds and so 

on in terms of total irrigated land and b) 

predominance of small and marginal farmers 
in overall agriculture production. Dominance of Small and Marginal 
FarmersThe distribution of landholding is 
skewed towards small and marginal farmers 
and the average size of holding is low.  The 

semi-medium, medium and large farmers 

accounted for a small proportion (9 percent) 

of the holdings but operating a higher 

proportion (41 percent) of the total area.  The 

average size of holding was higher in the 
case of large farmers (20.59 ha.) followed 

by medium farmers (5.61 ha).  The overall 
average size of land holding had come down 

from 0.83 ha. in 2005-06 to 0.80 ha. in 2010-

11. (Graph 3.1.1). Graph 3.1.1: Land Holding Pattern in Tamil Nadu (in Lakh Nos) Source : Dept. of Economics and Statistics, GoTNThe reduction in land holding size in 
Tamil Nadu directly affects the productivity 

as the farmer would not be able to afford 
the investments required for technological 
improvements. Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 

envisages functional consolidation of holdings 

through cooperative farming, contract farming 

and other mechanisms such as farmer 

groups and joint liability groups and implies 

the urgent need to increase the penetration 

of modern agricultural technologies and 

improve output.62.66 (77%)

area in the State. An analysis of time series 

data on net cultivated area and land put to 

non-agricultural uses in the State clearly 

reveals the above fact. (Graph. 3.1.2)  Land 
put to non-agricultural purposes increased 

from 9.8 percent in 1950s to 14.56 percent in  

1990s and reached 16.17 percent in 2000s, 

which is mainly due to urbanization and 
industrialization.  The trend in decrease in 

net area sown was analyzed and the net area 
sown came down from 56.38 Lakh hectares 
(L.ha) in 1950s to 50.22 L.ha. in 2000s though 

it had registered some increase during the 

mid 60s and 70s.  The main challenges faced 


deterioration in soil health due to depletion 
of top soil and decline in organic content, 

marginalization of landholdings, dwindling 

ground water resources, shortage of labour 

force, declining cropping intensity and poor 

adoption of crop management practices.  The 
Twelfth Five Year Plan will make efforts to 

address these issues by bringing back the 
fallow lands under cultivation of oilseeds, 

pulses and millets.Review of the Eleventh Five Year 
Plan PerformanceMany initiatives were undertaken during the Eleventh Five Year Plan apart from implementing various schemes.  As 
against the outlay of 
`2885.90 crore for Crop 

Husbandry sector, an amount of 
`3063.04 crore was spent (106 percent). The actual 
expenditure is much more under Government 

of India and World Bank projects.  The 

expenditure is higher than the outlay due to 
the implementation of National Agricultural 
Development Programme (NADP), National 

Food Security Mission (NFSM), Integrated 

Scheme for Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil palm and 

Maize (ISOPOM), Crop Insurance Schemes, 

Seeds Multiplication Scheme of paddy, 

millets, pulses, oilseeds and cotton and 

World Bank assisted Tamil Nadu Irrigated 

Agriculture Modernization and Waterbodies 

Restoration and Management Project (TN 

IAMWARM) etc.For effective delivery of quality 
inputs and extension services, additional 

initiatives such as establishment of 18 Seed 

Testing Laboratories, nine new Bio Fertilizer 

Production Labs in addition to six existing 

units, 11 Soil Testing Laboratories, Agri Clinic 

cum Mini Soil Testing Laboratories at one per 

block, Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) for 

medium range weather forecast in 224 blocks 

and 79 seed storage godowns to store 79,000 


Further, Agriculture Information Service 

Network (AGRISNET) was developed as an

Plan period registered a positive growth of 

2.22 percent as it recovered in the later years 

due to the favourable conditions in 2010 to 

2012.  The negative growth during 2007-
08 was due to the crop damage caused by 
natural calamities.  In spite of the crop loss 

due to Nisha cyclone, agriculture growth had 

shown recovery during 2008-09, due to many

Rice 
Rice is the staple food occupying 33 percent of the gross area sown.  Of the total 
rice area, 93 percent is irrigated and balance 

is under rainfed lands mostly under semi-
dry conditions. The normal area under rice 

is 19.32 L. ha and production is 56.63 L.MT.Table 3.1.2: Area, Production and Yield of Major Agricultural CropsYear Area (L. ha)Production (L.MT.)Yield (Kg/ha.)

increased from 66.11 L.MT (2006-07) to 75.96 
(2011-12) L.MT.  Due to natural calamities, 
rice production in the State was around 

50-52 L.MT during initial years of the Plan.  

Productivity of rice increased from 3423 kg/

ha (2006-07) to 3746 kg/ha. (2011-12). Technical Intervention for Rice 
Production In Tamil Nadu, System of Rice 

introduced in a big way in the year 2007-
08 and efforts were taken to popularize the 

technology and for its adoption over a larger 

area.  In the year 2007-08, 4.21 L.ha. paddy 

area was brought under SRI out of total 

paddy area of 17.89 L.ha. which was only 24 
percent.  Productivity achievement under SRI 

was 4051 kg/ha. increase of 66 percent over 
the conventional method.  With the objective 

of increasing rice production in districts 

wherein potential exists to expand area and 

increase productivity, National Food Security 

Mission (NFSM) is being implemented in 

Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Pudukottai, 

Ramanathapuram and Sivagangai districts.  

Implementation of Seed Multiplication /Seed 

Village schemes has resulted in increased 

seed replacement rate to 68 percent against 


of India.MilletsThe main reasons for drastic 
reduction of area under millets over the 



wheat, less returns to farmers, absence of 

added economic value based food items, 

changing lifestyle of the people, mismatch 

between minimum support price and cost 

of cultivation, less area under irrigation and 

cultivation of local varieties.Millets occupy 11 percent of the 
gross area sown and the major millets 
cultivated are Cholam, Cumbu, Maize and 

Ragi.  Normal area under millets is 7.07 L.ha 

and production is 15.57 L.MT. Technical 

interventions such as adoption of millet based 
cropping system, use of hybrids, precision 

farming and implementation of schemes 

such as procurement and distribution of 

millet seeds, ISOPOM-Maize, NADP and 

Seed Village scheme brought in substantial 

improvement in productivity and production. 



production from 13.62 L.MT to 24.31 L.MT 
and productivity enhanced from 1950 kg/

ha to 3022 kg/ha. during the Eleventh 

Five Year Plan period. Maize, being a highly 

remunerative crop also paved the way for 
shift in cropping pattern and increase in area 
under millets. Area under maize registered an 

increase from 1.97 to 3.44 L.ha. production 
increased from 7.59 to 17.81 L.MT and yield 

increased from 3888 to 5176 kg/ha. during 

the Eleventh Five Year Plan period.  Pulses Pulses occupy nearly 11 percent of 
the gross area sown in the state of which 
only 8.73 percent is irrigated.  Normal area 

under pulses is 5.80 L.ha and the normal 
production is 2.24 L.MT. With an objective of 

increasing the production and productivity of 

pulses and bridging the demand Œ supply gap, 
pulses were promoted as pure crop under 

irrigated condition on cluster basis. Suitable 

strategies were adopted in rice fallow pulses 

and rainfed areas under NFSM.  Similarly, 
foliar spraying of 2 percent DAP from 2007-08, 



2010-11 under NADP and implementation 

of Accelerated Pulses Production Programme 

(A3P) from 2010-11 with an objective to 

bring a compact area of 1000 hectares per 
unit purely under pulses helped the State to 

increase pulses production.Food grains 
The area and production of food 
grains registered an increase from 31.66 L.ha 

to 37.16 L.ha and 82.64 L.MT to 103.85 L.MT 
respectively during the Eleventh Five Year 



programmes such as NFSM, A3P and NADP 
led to considerable increase in the area and 
production of food grains. 46Cotton 
Cotton occupies nearly 2 percent 
of the gross area sown.  The normal area 
under cotton is 1.09 L.ha. with a production 

of 2.24 lakh bales (170 kg lint each).  With 

an objective to increase the production 

and productivity of cotton, schemes viz., 

procurement and distribution of cotton seeds, 

Technology Mini Mission-II for cotton, NADP 

and increasing production of cotton using 

growth promoter-Naphthalene Acetic Acid 
(NAA), TNAU cotton plus and micronutrient 

mixture were implemented in the State. 

The major technological interventions like 
adoption of precision farming, micro irrigation 

systems such as drip and sprinklers at 
subsidized cost motivated cotton growers to 

take up cultivation extensively. The area and 
production increased from 1.00 L.ha to 1.45 
L.ha. and from 2.21 L.bales to 3.78 L.bales 
respectively during the Eleventh Five Year 

Plan period. Sugarcane 
Sugarcane is a major irrigated crop of 
the State next to rice which plays a vital role 

in the State™s economy.  It is a high water 

and labour intensive crop occupying 5.5 

percent of the gross area sown. The normal 

area, production and productivity of the crop 
is 3.38 L. ha. 375.23 L.MT and 108 MT (cane) 
per ha respectively.  In the year 2011-12, the 

area, production and productivity were 3.82 

L. ha. 393.67 L. MT and 108 MT (cane) per 

ha. respectively.Oilseeds 

productivity of oilseeds in the country.  

Oilseeds occupy 7.7 percent of the gross area 

sown.  Major oilseeds grown in Tamil Nadu are 


The normal area under oilseeds was 5.56 

L.ha. of which groundnut occupies 4.75 L.ha. 

The normal production of oilseeds is 11.13 

L.MT. Normal production and productivity of 

groundnut are 9.93 L.MT and 2323 kg per 
 ha. respectively.During 2007-08, almost all the 
districts witnessed low productivity and the 

State recorded 1747 kg per ha. from an area 

of 6.59 L.ha. resulting in production of 11.52 
L.MT.  In the succeeding years, even though 

the area declined substantially, productivity 

in most of the districts was found to be higher 

with reference to the State average.  During 

the Eleventh Five Year Plan, components 

such as procurement and distribution of 

quality seeds, combined nutrient spray 

under ISOPOM, micro irrigation and gypsum 

distribution for groundnut under NADP 



were recorded. There was a 48 percent yield 

increase with water saving to an extent 
of 30-40 percent and higher oil content 

was recorded under precision farming.  

Factors attributed for steady increase in the 


seeds, b) promotion of micro irrigation in a 

larger extent, c) encouragement of farmers 

by the adoption of seed village scheme and 

d) Integrated Nutrient and Pest Management

farmers through the Agricultural Engineering 

Department (AED).  The available machinery 

in the AED is not adequate to meet the 

requirement of the farmers. During the 

Eleventh Five Year Plan under NADP, 50 
percent subsidy assistance to the tune 

of `162.20 crore was given to farmers 
for promotion of agricultural machinery 

and 7807 power tillers, 3414 rotovators, 

987 paddy transplanters, 765 paddy 

combine harvesters and 48,144 numbers of 

agricultural machinery / implements were 

procured.  Also, under the centrally sponsored 


Mode Programme, agricultural machinery/ 
implements were popularized among the 

farming community so as to supplement the 

available farm power, to meet out shortage of 
agricultural labourers, to ensure timeliness 

in carrying out various farm operations and 
to increase agricultural production.  Subsidy 

assistance was given to farmers to the tune 
of `38.15 crore which includes the State 
share of `3.81 crore to procure 1072 tractors, 
7730 power tillers, 1535 rotovators and 572

poor discharge compared to their rated 

horsepower. In order to overcome these 

setbacks and with an aim to save electricity, 

subsidy assistance was provided to farmers 

for replacing their old pumpsets and

Revitalizing Agriculture 
Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 envisages that 
infrastructure development in agriculture are 

a) improving the productivity in agriculture, 

b) assurance of year round irrigation and 

c) marketing extension. With this in view, 
the Twelfth Five Year Plan has focused on 
strategies to achieve an AAGR of 5.0 percent 

in agriculture and allied sector. The hiatus in agriculture is mainly 
due to deteriorating soil health, declining 

water resources, inadequate investment in 

rural infrastructure, inadequate research 50& development activities and spiraling 
prices of inputs, change in the mindsets of 

people viewing agriculture as of low value.  

To break this hiatus, the government is 
actively formulating farmer/farm oriented, 



with adequate investment in developing 

rural infrastructure to augment agricultural 
production.Farmers are motivated to adopt 
professional approach in agriculture by 

measures such as bringing fallow lands 

under cultivation, adoption of two-pronged 

approach to obtain high productivity by 

identifying districts having large cropped area 

but less productivity and districts having 

high productivity but less cropped area, 



high productivity, promotion of zonewise 



adoption of frontier production technologies 

are proposed.  In addition to this, multiple

Union Planning Commission highlights the 

decline in net area sown due to diversion 

of agricultural lands for urbanization and 

industrialization purposes. It has also 

suggested that reasonable restrictions on 

acquisition of multi-crop irrigated land should 

be laid and wherever net area sown is less 
than 50 percent of total geographical area, 

the State concerned should necessarily set 

a cap on cultivable area to be acquired. The

resources available, a farm based plan needs 

to be developed for harnessing the synergy 

among the enterprises which will ultimately 

provide a higher income. So far, no such plan

New Interventions: System of Rice Intensification (SRI) 
Technology as a village conceptIn spite of introduction of SRI 
four years ago, yield gap still exists due to 
non-adoption of all critical technological 

components and this necessitates the 

promotion of SRI as a village concept. Under 

this concept, rice growing villages will be 

selected and promoted on cluster basis to 
ensure perfect adoption of the technology. 

This scheme will be implemented with the 

creation of community nursery; pooling 
and timely provision of resources / inputs 

such as water, seeds, fertilizers including 

bio-fertilizers, plant protection chemicals, 

machinery, etc; conduct of demonstration 


place, convincing the laggards of the same 
village and motivating the farmers of nearby 

villages; minimizing cost of cultivation by 

optimal and localized need based timely 

management of resources to augment 





locations will be attempted. The Government has announced 
prize money and a medal worth `3500 to 
encourage paddy cultivation using SRI 

technology.  Farmers who have cultivated 

paddy in minimum 50 cents of land and 
achieved a yield of more than 2500 kg of 

paddy in an acre are eligible to participate in 

the SRI yield contest.   5555System of Rice Intensification - SuitabilitySynergy of the recommended twelve 
critical steps of SRI, when adopted in toto, 
would lead to considerable increase in rice 

yield. In SRI, alternate wetting and drying is 

an important step to ensure root aeration. 
SRI should not be adopted where soil and 
water conditions are not suitable like low 

lying areas. While SRI adoption has been 

given more emphasis in the Twelfth Plan 
striving to achieve the target of 16.50 L. ha, 

care has to be taken to spread the SRI in the 
suitable areas only. Millets Mission 
In the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it is 
proposed to introduce an Integrated Millets 

Mission through a convergent approach 

by involving Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Civil Supplies and Consumers™ 

Protection as well as Department of 

Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business.   

Farmers all over the State will greatly be 





millets in PDS and creating business 

incubators for millets would help the millet 

farmers to a large extent. Agriculture and 
food production by the small and marginal 

farmers who are vulnerable will be improved 

by introduction of Millets Mission. Box 3.1.1: Snapshot of SPC 
Millets WorkshopState Planning Commission organised a workshop to promote millets 
in the State where the stakeholders 
from Government of India, Government 



Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing, 
Social Welfare, Health, Cooperation and 

Civil Supplies, Horticulture, Animal 

Husbandry, Research Institutions, 
Researchers, Academic Professionals, 
NGOs and Operational Functionaries 

like food processing entrepreneurs, 

farmers also were present.   The major 






concept, increasing area under millets by 

bringing in the fallow lands, incentivisation 

of small entrepreneurs, formation of millet 
clusters and CLGs. While the above will 
address the supply issues with regard to 

millets production, demand also needs to 

be generated by popularization of millets 


addition with millets, popularization of 

millet based nutrient diet and changing 

dietary habits.Source: State Planning Commission, GoTNIndia, despite being one of the 
emerging economies, is ranked as low as 128 
among the malnourished nations; i.e., lower 

than even some of the sub-Saharan African 

countries. A recent study has further indicated 
that almost 20 percent of all diabetes cases in 

India are due to rice consumption. A similar 

study in Tamil Nadu has revealed equal or 

higher incidence of diabetes. This needs 

immediate attention. Introducing millets 

in our diet which was in vogue during our 
ancestral period could resolve this anomaly. 



are way ahead of rice and wheat in terms 
of nutritional content. For instance, millets 

contain 10.6 grams of protein per kilogram, 

as against rice which contains only 6.8 grams.          56
grams to 10.1 grams), minerals (1.9 grams to 

4.4 grams) and calcium (31 mg to 344 mg) in 
comparison to rice. Millets are crops that can 

survive adverse climate change conditions. 

It has been shown that millets can grow in 

conditions of low rainfall requiring as little 

as 300 to 350 mm depending on the type of 

millet and in poor and heavily degraded soils, 

which are the characteristic traits of the arid 
and semi-arid regions of the State. All these 

characteristics make millets the ideal crop for 

the climate crisis that is looming ahead of our 

State. Twelfth Five Year Plan Strategy for

Market LinkagesBusiness Incubators for Millets.  Ensuring millets and millet based 
value added foods in the ready-to-eat and 

ready-to-cook form is the need of the hour.  For 
this, establishment of business incubators is 

essential. Business incubators for processing 

of millets and production of millet based 

value added products will be established 

by entrepreneurs.  These incubators 

help to upscale processing methods for 

development of traditional foods, production 
of millet based bakery products, millet based

Mission, setting up these incubators is 

proposed and will be implemented through 
Department of Agricultural Marketing and 

Agri Business.Modernisation of Millet Processing Unit 
and Value Addition. Millets being small seeded, contain 
large proportions of husk and bran which 

requires de-husking and de-braning prior 

to consumption.  Despite their nutritional 

superiority, utilization of millets is restricted 



millets in ready-to-eat form.  Hence, millets 





processing units are essential to increase 

the availability of millets in the ready-to-use 

form.  Financial assistance for establishment 

of modern millets based processing units and 

modernization of existing millet processing 

units to increase the recovery percentage 

are the required strategies to achieve the 

objectives.  The proposed Millets Mission 

would extend such necessary assistance 

through Department of Agricultural 

Marketing and Agri Business.Distribution of Millets through PDS. 
Millets are also consumed by a certain 
percentage of high end consumers.  A study on preference of food grains indicated that 
consumers may be willing to increase the 

offtake of millets through PDS if it is made 

available at the outlets.  Hence, through the 
Millets Mission, it is suggested to provide 

three kg of any one of the available millets 
to all family card holders.  The family card 

holders eligible for rice could be provided with 
three kg of millets per month if requested 

at no additional cost.  The other category 

of family card holders will be provided with 

three kg of millets at subsidized rate. The 

total requirement of millets for 1.97 crore 

family card holders will be 59,100 tonnes/

ApproachesDuring the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it is 
proposed to take up detailed soil survey with 
the objective of identifying saline and alkaline 

soils and to reclamation of the problem soils. 

It is also proposed to take efforts to develop 

irrigation sources such as farm ponds, 

check dams, percolation ponds, etc., to meet 

the irrigation water requirement of rainfed 

crops at critical stage, for which funds 

under various schemes viz., A3P, Initiatives 

for Nutritional Security through Intensive 
Millets Promotion (INSIMP) and Rainfed 

Area Development Programme (RADP) will 
be dovetailed. (Detailed proposals on soil 

management are dealt in the sub chapter viz., 
3.2. Soil and Water Conservation including 

Rainfed Farming) Precision FarmingPrecision farming is an innovative 
method in which all the cultivation protocols 

are undertaken very accurately. Key steps 

viz., chisel ploughing, transplanting of 

young seedling, adopting recommended 
spacing, installing drip and micro irrigation 
and timely application of critical inputs are 

followed.   Upon success of the programme 

and unprecedented level of acceptance of the

project to cover 1 lakh ha. under precision 
farming during the Twelfth Five Year Plan 
period.  Further it is also proposed to form 

precision vegetable clusters with market 

tie up or direct marketing by farmers by 
incorporating producers companies.National Mission on Micro 
Irrigation (NMMI)The conventional method of irrigation 
requires more water leading to wastage.  The 
use of micro irrigation systems like drip, 



of surface as well as ground water resources.  

Each drop of water is made productive in this 

technology. Uniform crop growth and produce 

size are achieved through this method.  Using 

micro irrigation, more area can be brought 

under cultivation with less water.  NMMI 

is a centrally sponsored scheme,  in which  

100 percent subsidy is given to small and 

marginal farmers (50 percent by Centre and 

50 percent by State) and 75 percent (40 
percent by Centre and 35 percent by State) 
to other category farmers for installation of 

drip, sprinkler and raingun systems for all 
horticulture crops and agriculture crops 

like sugarcane, coconut, cotton, maize, 

groundnut and pulses.  This scheme is being 

implemented only through registered and 



Twelfth Five Year Plan period, it is proposed 

cover an area of 3.10 lakh ha. under micro 

irrigation (1.86 L.ha. under horticulture 

crops and 1.24 L.ha under agriculture crops).Micro Irrigation Model VillagesTo give a big push to extend the 
area coverage under micro irrigation, a 

model village in each district will be set up 

to demonstrate the advantages of micro 

irrigation.  It is also proposed to provide micro 

irrigation equipments at subsidised cost and 
impart training to the farmers.6161Approach and Strategies for

Crops through Participatory 
ApproachWith the advent of hybrid technology, 
the farmers are required to replenish seeds 
every season from external sources such 

as research institutions, public and private 

sector seed producers to harness hybrid 

vigour. This has increased the productivity 



increased farmers™ dependence on external 
agencies. As a result, the informal and 

decentralized village seed industry has now 

been replaced by highly centralized seed 

market. However, it is almost impossible for 
the organized sector to meet farmers demand 
for the seed, considering the number of crops and varieties cultivated across the country.  

In this back drop, the concept of ‚seed village™ 



production and distribution of quality seeds, 

is fast gaining momentum. Seed villages 

or village seed banks operate with utmost 

transparency, mutual trust and social 
responsibility of the seed producing farmers 

towards seed using fellow farmers and under 

peer supervision. The establishment of village 

seed banks not only ensure good quality 
seeds for enhancing productivity, but also 

help in generating income for the community 
members resulting in improved livelihoods. It 

is proposed to form 7000 Commodity Interest 

Groups, 5000 village seed banks and to train 

1.25 lakh farmers.  6363Seed Certification

soil health, it is proposed to produce and 

distribute liquid bio-fertilizers which have 

advantages such as longer shelf life of 12 

to 14 months, free of contamination, higher 
microbial population, cost effective and easy 

to use  Referral Laboratories for Complete 
Soil AnalysisThe era of indiscriminate use of NPK is 
over and due to dwindling supply of organics to soil, the soil organic carbon, humus and 
microbial load have come down considerably 

and the soil has also lost the micronutrient 

replenishing capacity in locations where 
two crops in a year or crops like turmeric, 

tapioca, banana, sugarcane are cultivated. 

Hence, external application of micronutrients 
for every crop and every season has become 

compulsory. The foliar application is only 

supplementary while the soil requires 

regular application. The existing soil testing 

laboratories have the facility to analyze NPK, 

micronutrients, Electrical Conductivity (EC), 

pH etc.The proposed referral laboratory for 
complete soil analysis lends support to the 

farmer by providing micronutrient analytical 

information for better productivity of crops. 

The complete soil analysis includes the 

estimation of micro organism status of the 
soil. One such common facility for the state 

with capacity to handle 1000 samples a day 

shall serve the purpose. The approximate 

outlay proposed is   `5.00 crore.Efficiency in Use of Chemical 
FertilizersTamil Nadu is adopting a multipronged 
strategy to maintain soil health and fertility 
status of the soil by the balanced application 

of inorganic and organic fertilizers. Schemes 

such as balanced and integrated use of 

fertilizers, production and distribution of 

bio-fertilizers, procurement and distribution 

of green manure seeds, vermi-composting of 

farm waste, composting of farm wastes with 
Pleurotus are implemented.Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) was 





continue to increase their retail prices (RP) 

without prior notice frame, citing hike in the 
international prices of raw materials. For 

example, DAP (50kg bag) cost increased by 

187 percent over MRP (`990/-) in 2011 from 
`468.20/- in 2010. To reduce the burden of 

farmers, the Tamil Nadu Government has 
exempted 4 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) 


64present NBS system is detrimental to farmers, 
the GOI may intervene by revising (increasing) 
the subsidy. Liquid biofertilizer producing centres 
will be established to improve the shelf life of 

biofertilizers, at a cost of 
`2.75 crore through 
GOI assisted funds.Fertilizer2012-132013-142014-152015-162016-17

ConsumptionThe successful adoption of Non-
Pesticidal Management (NPM) in several 
rainfed and irrigated cropping systems has 

led to change in policy and research. Tamil 

Nadu is particularly attentive to increased 

adoption of this productivity enhancing, 

cost-effective and eco-friendly production 

practices.The increased use of pesticides has 
disturbing consequences on the farming 

system, particularly, due to the development 

of resistance, resurgence of insect pests and 
decline in population of the natural enemies 

of pests.  Over-use of pesticides may lead 

to serious repercussion on environment 

and ecology. Hence, it is imperative to step 

up investment in research and technology, 

development of organic and bio-pesticides 

that are more effective in managing crops 
in an environmentally sustainable manner.

With an aim to achieve a growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent in horticulture, 
more area will be brought under horticulture 



low income generating crops to high value 
horticulture crops. The overall production 

and productivity of the horticulture crops 

will be doubled during the Twelfth Five Year 

Plan period.  Horticultural Parks for fruits, 

vegetables and spices would be developed 

across the state.  More thrust will be given 

to micro irrigation with fertigation, precision 

farming, hi-density planting and organic 

cultivation by which large area will be 

covered under horticulture crops thereby the 

productivity per drop of water integrated crop 

management, post harvest management and 

market linkages and per unit area will be 

enhanced.6565Urban Organic Cultivation 
Increase in personal disposable income and awareness on food safety among urban dwellers have opened the gates for 
urban organic cultivation of vegetables.  The 
consumers are getting the information on 

harmfulness of pesticides on human health 

and their entry into food chain through 

effective media and internet. Kitchen 

gardening and terrace gardening are handy 

tools that could satisfy the vegetable needs 
of most of the nuclear families of the urban 

centres.  Besides the above, these gardens 

act as potential stress reducers.  Models of 
kitchen gardening and terrace gardening 

to suit the urban consumers are already 

available with TNAU and matching the 

requirements of consumers is the only need. 

Hence, in the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it has 

been proposed to convert the awareness into 
actual kitchen and terrace garden models 

through capacity building programmes.  

The IEC funds available in the existing 
horticultural programmes will be utilized.   Popularising of Banana Cultivation

Company, TheniBanana Growers Association with 
3,500 small farmers and a trader in a joint venture project in agriculture promoted a 
popular banana variety and cultivation 

has been undertaken in 20, 000 acres at 
Theni. Trader has established a ripening 
and a cold storage facility of 200 MT 

capacity at an investment of `20.00 crore. 

This has opened up the avenue of exporting 

to Dubai when they are competing with 

Maharashtra banana. The initiative of 

common ripening and storage facility has 

increased the prospects of Theni banana 

growers over the past 6 years.Source : Dept. of Horticulture and Plantation Crops, GoTN. The Banana Growers™ Association

district.  Farmers of the above tracts will be 

given exposure visits to Theni to emulate 

similar successful models in their locality.  

Also, capacity building programmes will 
be arranged for institutional building and

pumps. With availability of better paying 

service sector and construction jobs, 

increased migration from agriculture to other 
sectors is observed in Tamil Nadu during 
the last decade. To increase the productivity 

of the land and to cope up with shrinking 

agricultural manpower, mechanisation is 
not only essential but also imperative. The 

constraints in promotion of mechanisation 

include non standardized agricultural 
practices, small and marginal land holdings, 

low investment capacity of farmers, lack of 

know-how and non availability of service 

and maintenance facilities. Policy and 

structural mechanisms shall be developed to 

address these issues and support increased 

mechanisation in all phases of agriculture 

(Vision Tamil Nadu 2023).

agricultural machinery and equipments will 

be procured by PACCS for custom hiring 

to farmers. For this, the societies are being 
provided with a subsidy of 50 percent of the

the State Grid on the other. 6767Establishment of Agro Service Unit 
in every PACCSIt is proposed to establish an agro 
service unit in every Primary Agricultural 
Cooperative Credit Society (PACCS) in the 

State for providing necessary agricultural 

machinery/implements to the farmers on hire 

basis. As the farmers do not have adequate 

knowledge to operate and maintain the 

agricultural machinery, it is also proposed to 

form farmers group in the jurisdiction of every 
PACCS to render necessary service support 

to the farmers in that area on various aspects 

of operation, repair and maintenance of 

various agricultural machinery/implements. 

This farmers group will also take part in the 

activities like raising of seedlings, custom 

hiring, supply of machinery and labour for 

various agricultural operations in that area. 

In Tamil Nadu, 4534 numbers of PACCS 

are functioning. It is proposed to continue 

the programme of providing agricultural 
machinery/implements to 3500 PACCS.
Mode Approach to increase the pace of 
agricultural mechanisation in the State and 



& water resources techniques for sustainable 

agriculture in rainfed areas. Crop varieties 
will be selected to suit the mechanization and 

facilitation for easy movement of machinery 

by adopting planned planting. Online Booking of Farm Machinery Presently, the farmer has to approach 
in person for booking the farm machinery in 
AED which drains time and money.  Hence, 
the Department of Agriculture has planned 

to provide an online booking system of farm 

machinery through the existing AGRISNET 

web portal.  With this system, the farmers 

can plan well ahead about the requirement of 

farm machinery and book it online through 

telephone and can make payment online 

through a payment gateway. This would help 

the farmers, to save time and money.SF and MF Friendly Machinery 
Average farm size in Tamil Nadu is 0.80 ha and it is declining year after year.  
The intensity of marginalization of holdings 

gets aggravated due to increase in population, 
subdivision and fragmentation.  On the 

other hand, increasing labour shortage in 

agriculture has resulted in dependence of 

machinery.  Owing to the size of holdings, the 
capacity utilization of the machinery is not 

achieved in most of the farms as the existing 
machinery are designed for larger farm size.  

Increased availability of machinery in villages 

has reduced the potential revenue generation 

through custom hiring.  In this context, usage 

of these machinery that are in vogue in small 
farms of Korea and Japan would be a viable 

alternative.  Small size of these machinery 

demand relatively lesser initial capital and 

can be utilized fully in the small holdings.  

Hence, in the Twelfth Five Year Plan it has 

been proposed to popularize these small 

and marginal farmer friendly machinery.  In 
addition to this, plant breeders should give 

emphasis on developing varieties which 

facilitate the use of these types of machinery.
Crop Insurance - National 
Agricultural Insurance Scheme 

(NAIS)The State Government is making 

Insurance Schemes by introducing interim 
compensation to insured farmers, reducing 

the insurance unit area to revenue village level, 

uniform seasonality discipline, on account 

payment of claims for timely disbursement, 



to take risks in agriculture and protect them 
at the time of distress.The NAIS, since its inception has 
reached the pinnacle as of now in enrolling the 
farmers, area insured and premium subsidy.  

Initially, the farmers especially non-loanee 

farmers were reluctant to enroll under this 

scheme.  However, extension of 50 percent 

premium subsidy to both loanee and non-

loanee farmers brought higher percentage of 

farming community into the Crop Insurance 

Schemes. 68

pilot basis in selected blocks by removing 
the bottlenecks in the existing NAIS and

Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS)The critical stages of a crop such as 

stages are insured for weather parameters like 


humidity, consecutive dry days, wind speed, 

etc.  Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) have 

been established in 224 blocks and linked with 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University website 
to provide medium range weather forecast to 
carry out agriculture related activities by the 

farmers in time and also to provide weather 

data to the insurance companies. TNAU was

programmes were conducted to bring 
awareness about the products.Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme

with a production of 55,471 lakh nuts and 
productivity of 13,852 nuts/ha. and there 

are better prospects to bring more area 

and increase the production besides value 

addition.  Coconut cultivation is largely 

affected by natural calamities.  In view of 

this, CPIS has been introduced on pilot basis 
in 11 districts with the objective to provide 

insurance coverage against natural and other 

perils, provide relief against income loss, 

minimize risks and encourage replanting.  

Healthy nut bearing coconut palms grown as 
mono or intercrop, on bunds or homestead 

and all varieties of coconut (Tall varieties of 

7 to 60 years and Dwarf and hybrids of 4 to 

60 years) are insured.  Individual farmers/
growers cultivating atleast 10 healthy nut 

bearing palms are eligible for enrolment.  The 

subsidy pattern is 50 percent by CDB, 25 

percent by State government and 25 percent 
by farmer.  6969Rural transformation

ST farmers, following schemes are proposed 

in the Twelfth Five Year Plan.Purchase of Wetlands for SC/ST 
FarmersWetlands are of major importance 
in agricultural systems and are becoming 
even more valuable components of agro-

ecosystems. The general understanding was 

that SCs do not own contiguous areas and 
that their holdings are scattered in the midst 

of land held by others. It may be observed 

that nearly two-thirds of the SCs and over 80 

percent of the STs are engaged in agricultural 
activities. On the other hand, only about 

53 percent of the ‚Others™ are involved in 
these activities. By and large, the SC & 

ST population depend on rain water and 
natural water resources for cultivating their 



existing irrigational facilities as available to 

other agricultural communities.  Under this 

backdrop, it is imperative to provide wetlands 

to SC/ST farmers as it will be one of the viable 

livelihood to uplift the economic status of the 

farmers.  The scheme may be implemented 

by the Revenue Department.Apart from the above, a separate 
provision of outlay in case of IFS,

  Abstract
 Efficient and sustainable utilization of resources
, particularly land and water resource
s for agriculture 
have
 occupied the centre stage in the economic ag
enda of a nation. The regional resource availability
 and the 
 biotic, abiotic and socio
-economic constraints 
are 
largely 
varied in the any crop production system of 
that
 region. The integration of sustainable resource use with the production 
programs 
and i
ncome as objective
s of farming 
thus
, 
leads to a multiple objective
-planning framework. 
Attaining sustainable 
increase in 
agriculture production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural 
resources base is 
therefo
re 
very important to 
achieve
 food security for 
the growing population
 in a 
developing country situation
. The current study is to develop appropriate 
land use pattern in crop agriculture
 for sustainable land and water use to the agricultural 
development in the 
Bavani Basin
 of 
western zone of 
Tamil Nadu
 state 
in southern India
, 
using 
a multiple goal 
linear programming approach.
 Bhavani basin in the 
western zone of Tamil Nadu
 - one of the most diversified in bio physical feature
s, was evaluated 
in this study.
 The 
land use model 
 employed in the study following 
 the bio
-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, 
(2003) 
who 
incorporated 
the 
important variations in the biophysical system (land and soils) and 
market characteristics. 
This study 
traced th
e alternative cropping pattern which 
would 
maximize
s the farm 
net income 
at a relatively lower water requirement, 
lower land requirement (
hectare days to ensure 
relatively more fallow period 
to lower land exhaustion rate) 
and that would lower the environme
nt damage 
in-terms of lower Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) 
with the given land and ground water availability of 
each identified ten homogen
eous land units
 beside the len
gth of growing period determined on the basis of 
quantum
 and distribution of rainf
all and temperature
.  The major biophysical factor
s considered 
beside
 the 
land availability, ground and surface water availability
 were;
 crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop 
sequence and climatic variations and these factors were specified a
s constrain
ts in the land use model. The 
input data for the model 
were collected from 
the 
sample respondents in the 
delineated homogen
eous land 
units. The actual water availability for each standard week (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective 

rainfall received during the period of crop stand from the total water requirement of each crop activity.  
 The land use model 
estimats 
reveal
ed the
 possibility of increasing the crop income fr
om 
the 
current level of 
INR
 6.14 billion to 
INR 
8.25 b
illion annually
. This alternative crop plan also helped to reduce the area under 
high water consuming crop
s in water deficit area
s.  3   INTRODUCTION
 Economic development and human welfare largely depend on optimum utilization of natural resources. 
There exist
s a wide spatial diversity in quantity and quality of land and water resources 
available 
and 
their 
efficiency in use for agricultural and non
-agricultural purposes. Efficiency and sustainability paradigms have 
therefore occupied the centre stage in the econ
omic agenda of a nation. A large proportion of India™s land 
shows clear evidence of advanced and continuous degradation, threatening to undermine the capacity to 

increase food production and alleviate rural poverty (Abrol, 1994). Despite the critical situa
tion, the increase 

in population led to decline the per capita availability of net sown area from 1.76 ha in 1950
-51 to 0.
11 ha
 in 
Tamil Nadu in India
 in 
2007

8. On the other hand, the water availability for agriculture from both surface 
and ground wate
r sources 
was 
not able to meet the increasing demand by the changing cropping pattern and 
climatic variability. Annual internal renewable water resources in India fell by 652 cubic meter (cum)  per 

capita  in about 12 years i.e., from 1896 cum in 1988 to 1
244 cum in 2000 (HDR, 2000). The ground water 
estimation committee (1994) estimated the annual replenishable ground water potential to be 431 bcm and 

the ultimate irrigation potential in terms of area was estimated to be 80.38 mha. During the period from 
1984
-85 to 1998
-99, the number of dark
1 blocks (administrative unit consists of few villages) had increased 
from 253 to 428 at the national level. If this trend continues, the number of overexploited blocks would be 
doubled over a period of every twelve and
 half years (Swaminathan, 2002). In the State of Tamil Nadu the 
groundwater was over exploited in 54 bocks
 out of a total of 
385
-blocks
 which spread over in 16 districts 
(CWC, 2000). 
 
The integration of sustainable resource use with the production programs
 and income as objectives of 
farming thus, leads to a multiple objective
-planning framework. Attaining sustainable increase in agriculture 
production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural resources 

base is t
herefore very important to 
achieve
 food security for the growing population in a developing country 
situation. 
In 
such a 
situation
, there is an urgent need to identify concrete policy measures that would permit 
a simultaneous improvement of agricultural pr
oduction and conservation of natural resource base especially 

land and water resources. 
 Tamil Nadu 
state in 
southern 
India 
is divided into seven agro climatic zones based on rainfall distribution, 
irrigation pattern, soil characteristics, cropping pattern
, ecological and social characteristics. Among these 
seven zones, the Western zone consisting of Coimbatore and Erode districts 
covering Bhavani basin
 occupies 
12.03 per cent of the state
™s
 geographical area and 11.45 per cent of the state
™s
 net sown area.
 This zone 
accounts for 
close to 15 per cent of degraded land in the State. The western zone receives the lowest annual 

rainfall of 700 mm compared to the 959 mm for the State. Beside
s, well irrigation is 
the pre
domina
nt source 
of irrigation in this zone a
ccounting 
for 
about 53 per
 cent of total irrigated area. The depth of the water 
in 
this zone however, 
has fallen between 6 meters and 49.3 m
eters
 in the 
rainfall deficit years
 when the
 annual 
                                                 1 Dark block are were the groundwater extraction is more than recharge
 4  rainfall 
was 
around 450 mm. Due to poor maintenance and reductio
n 
in 
storage capacity of tanks, ponds and 
other small reservoirs 
also 
affect the groundwater recharge in th
is zone. The over extraction of groundwater 
and inefficient use of irrigation
 water
 for crops 
also 
leads to faster reduction in groundwater table. 
The current study therefore
 aims 
to answer the 
following 
question confronting the stakeholders in the region 
namely:
 1. What would be the optimal land allocation to different crop activities 
that will maximize the net 
farm income
 with the available 
land, 
water 
and environmental resources 
in 
the region?
  The overall objective of the study is to develop appropriate 
land use pattern in crop agriculture
 for 
sustainable land and water use to the agricultural development in the 
Bhavani basin of the 
west
ern zone of 
Tamil Nadu. 
 2. METHODOLOGY
 In India, private property right for land will leads to over exploitation of land, water other resources which 
causing spatial and temporal damages.  This study is indent to identify the land allocation pattern to th
e different crops and how the different resources or inputs like labour, water and credit are judiciously used to 

reach the maximum net return with the available production activities in the context of sustainability. In 
order to achieve the sustainability
 in land and water resources use, the spatial variability on bio
-physical 
characters must be considered. This would be achieved by 
identifying
 the homogeneous land which having 
same bio
-physical features of surface water availability, ground water status a
nd climatic feature like 
temperature, rainfall and Length of Growing period (LGP). 
 Land Use Model
 Land use studies dealing with the future prospects are generally of two types
 - predictive and explorative. 
The 
explorative land use studies focus more on de
fining the range of developmental possibilities at different 
scale (Van Ittersum 
et al
., 1998). These studies emphasized the biophysical possibilities, assuming that 
socioeconomic constraints could be managed in the long run (Van Keulen et al., 2000). Bio
-economic 
modeling (BEM) approach was used to analyze the combined effect of land degradation, population growth, 
market imperfections and increased risk of drought on household production, welfare and food security 
(Holden and Shiferaw, 2002). They used dy
namic non
-separable household model which maximized the 
household welfare. 
 The 
land use model
 employed in this study following 
the bio
-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, 
(2003) 
which 
incorporated 
the 
important variations in the biophysical system (lan
d and soils) and market 
characteristics. 
Loborte et. al.(2009) dev
eloped and evaluated the methodology for exploring the lan
ds use 
option at s
ub national level to improve the scientific basis for lands use planning which 
provide
d the 
facilities 
for land ev
aluation for resource availability, scenario construction and land use optimization. 
Following the 
methodology t
his study
 would 
trace the alternative cropping pattern which maximizes the farm net income 
5  with the given land and ground water availability of
 each identified ten homogen
eous land units
 (HLUs)
.  The 
land and water availability of the each 
HLU
s were taken as constrain
ts. The actual crop water availability for 
each standard week (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective 
rainfall received during the period of crop 
stand from the total crop water requirement of each crop activity. 
 Input
-output coefficients
 The input
-output coefficients for the land use model were estimated from
 a sample
 of 
330 farm households  
spread in 22
 villages covering all identified 10 land units. 
The distribution of the sample households among 
the 10 
HLU
s is presented in Table 1.

 was
 developed 
which 
would 
maximize  net 
income from crop enterprise
s in the region. Income from each 
crop 
activity was the major factor that would 
determine the selection of crops. Thus, the objective function was maximization of net income from cr

was assumed that only 60 per cent of total rainfall reaches soil profile and the remaining 40 per cent drained 
out through runoff and seepage. Then, the crop wise moisture availability through effective
 rainfall was 
estimated by adding these for respective weeks of crop stand in that location. The equation is as follows:

 was calculated as the perc
entage of gross cropped area (GCA) to the total cultivable 
land area available for cultivation (LA).
  *100GCA
CILA  Based on Subbian et al. (1999) Cumulative Land Utilization Index (CLUI) 
was calculated by summing the 
products of land area pl
anted to each crop and the actual duration of that crop in weeks and dividing this by 
the total cultivable land area times weeks.

would 
reach 
the 
maximum of 100 per cent when all 
the 
available land area was occupied by 
different
 crops throughout the year. 
Lesser CLUI with low level of water use that could generate maximum 
net income is preferred for 
land and water resources sustainability.
  Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
 is the ratio between the total net return realized from the irr
igated crop to total 
water used by the crop plan.

 Considering the complexity of the present static land use model for 10 different 
HLU
s, the General Algebraic 
Modeling System (GAMS 22.9, 2009) was used for developing the land use model. The model con
sist
ed of 
260 (10x26) crop activities with 520 (10x 26 x 2) equations each for land and water resources, 260 (10x24) 
equations for crop suitability constraints. Thus, totally 260 activities and 1040 constraints besides the non
-zero equations were used in f
ormulating the land use model and solved 
using
 GAMS. 
 3. Results and Discussion
 The results and discussions 
included
; the 
descri
ption
 the land area availability, delineation of the 
homogenous land units
, followed by the model results
.   The 
Bhavani 
basin of 
western zone of Tamil Nadu was divided into 10 agro
-ecological 
HLU
s by overlaying the 
three spatial attributes 
namely;
 (i)
availability of surface irrigation, (command area map)
; (ii)
 ground water 
categorization based on the ext
raction 
levels of ground water; 
and 
(iii) 
the climatic feature (by developing 
the length of growing period 
- LGP) using GIS overlay technique and the same is presented in the map (Figure 
1). 
 3.1 
General 
Characteristics
 of the sample farms
 identified 
in th
e HLUs 
 The farm and famer™s 
general 
characters such as
; farm size, family size, main and secondary occupation, 
family labour availability for farm operation were analyzed fr
om the sample data collected for each 
of the 
HLUs.
 The average farm size was 0.72, 1.64 and 4.95 ha for marginal, small and medium to large size farm 
categories, respectively. The marginal and small farmers constituted about 59 per cent of the total number
 of 
sample operational holdings in the 
Bhvani basin of 
western zone 
in Tamil Nadu 
and they operated only 15 
per cent of the cultivable area. The average family size in different farm size groups ranged from 4.00 

(marginal farms) to 4.68 members per family 
(in large farms) in which children constituted 15.19 per cent of 

the family size. Male members engaged in agricultural operations constituted 73 per cent, whereas, two 
thirds of the females were engaged in the agricultural operations. 
 11  3.2 Operational Expe
nditure for Major Crops 
under Homogenous Land Units 
 The operational expenditure for cultivating major crops in the western zone was estimated from the sample 
farms 
(Table 3) 
to derive the net income per hectare realized from each crop in each 
of the HLUs
. The 
operational expenditure includes all the paid out cost on inputs except the fixed cost
. The results indicated 
that the operational cost was the highest for sugarcane (
INR
 59484 per ha.) followed by 
INR
 58385, 
INR
 51864, 
INR
 43893 and 
INR
 28528 per ha for banana, turmeric, tapioca and groundnut, respectively. The 
cultivation expenses of kharif paddy was 
INR
 19027 while for rabi paddy it was 
INR
17840 per ha. Among 
different homogenous land units, farmers incurred marginally higher operatio
nal expenses in ayacut land 
units
 (irrigated) 
such as; 1CA, 1OA, 1RA, 1SA and ICG for most of the crops; this may be due to higher use of 
inputs to achieve the targeted yield with the limited resources
. Table

   12  3.3 Productivity of
 major Crops u
nder Homogenous Land Units 
 The productivity of major crops was estimated and the results would reveal that the average productivity of 
kharif paddy, rabi paddy, ragi and maize was 
52, 40, 30 and 29 qt
l/ha,
 respectively. The district average
 yield 
of these crops were 
33.11,
 29.06, 23.8 and 11.25 qtl per 
ha 
in Coimbatore district and 39.6, 41.65, 23.8 and 
22.8 qtl per ha f
or Erode district, respectively. The average yield of sugarcane (as main crop) was 108
0 qtl
/ha. 
While, the district average
 productivity of sugarcane was 87
0 and 102
0 qtl
/ha in Coimbatore and Erode 
districts
, respectively
. The variation in crop productivity among the land units was however less as revealed 
from the coefficient of variation with exception of 37 per cent of CV f
or rainfed maize
. 3.4 Net Income of Major Crops in Different Homogenous Land Unit Categories 
 The net income over the operational cost was estimated for the major crops in each 
of the HLUs 
and the 

result showed that turmeric recorded the maximum net income
 of 
INR 
71848 per ha over operational cost, 
followed by banana (
INR
. 70827) and sugarcane (
INR
. 46767). The low water consuming crops 
yielded net 
returns 
as follows
; cotton (
INR
. 13265), groundnut (
INR
. 44181), maize (
INR
. 10021) and onion (
INR
. 55762). 
In the ayacut land units (1CA, 1OA, 1RA, 1SA and ICG), the net return realized were comparatively higher at 
INR
 16679 vs 11296 for kharif paddy, 
INR
 8842 vs 
INR
. 6899 for rabi paddy, 
INR
 48433 vs 39928 for 
groundnut, 79050  vs 66086 for turmeric and 
INR
. 581
23 vs 35411 for sugarcane. The net income realized in 
each crop activity 
was considered in the land use model.
 3.5 Current Cropping Pattern in Different 
HLUs
  The alternative crop sets were optimize using the static land use model by using linear programmi
ng 
(LP) approach for each homogeneous land units with given land and water resource availability. In the land 

availability constraints 1.92 
lakh
 ha was excluded which covers area under Tamarind, Guava, Mango, 
Coconut, Tea and Coffee. Similarly, the net gro
und water availability was estimated with the average pump 
output, well output in liter per second in each homogeneous land units for 52 standard weeks. 
The current 

cropping pattern revealed,
 after excluding area under perennial crops
/trees
, 17 major crops
 were cultivated 
in different 
HLUs
 of about 4.45 lakh ha in 2004
-05. In order to understand the current status of the present 
cropping pattern, various efficiency indicators such as cropping intensity, cumulative land utilization index, 
share of the high a
nd low water consuming crops, commercial crops, rainfed crops and area under vegetable
 crops
 were 
aggregated 
for each 
HLU
 and the results are presented in Table 
4. The analysis presented in 
Table 
4 would show that
 paddy was cultivated 
in 
little
 over 
58,000
 ha followed by 
maize and sugarcane 
with
 30281
 ha
 and 25831 ha, respectively under irrigated condition. Groundnut, 
sorghum, pulses and fodder sorghum were the major rainfed crops 
that 
constituted 43
-57 per cent of 
cropped area. Groundnut cover
ed 47530 ha, 
next to sorghum
 with 91500 ha
. The fodder sorghum occupied 
52300 
ha. The cropping intensity was relatively high in 1OA, 1CA followed by 1CG under ayacut land units 
(133, 120 and 119 per cent
, respectively) 
whereas;
 it was 123, 128 and 105 under Non
-Ayacut (0RG, 0CA, 
0RA) land units. However cumulative land utilization index was relatively less in irrigated land units 
at 
38 per 
13  cent compared to 46 per cent in Non
-ayacut units. It 
would also be surprising
 to note that the area under 
high water consumi
ng crop
s (paddy, banana, turmeric
, tobacco 
and sugarcane) constituted almost 65 per 
cent of the area in non
-ayacut land units but it was around 31 per cent in ayacut land units. This need
ed 
 to 
be 
watched 
in terms
 of changes 
in the alternative crop set
 as we aim at a sustainable cropping pattern in this 
analysis
. Rainfed crops normally dominated in non ayacut land units.

 The 
analysis of
 HLU
 wise cropping pattern clearly 
revealed the fact 
that the current cropping pattern is 
ground water exploit
ative in
 nature
, particularly 
in ground water deficit 
HLUs 
(0CA, 0OA, 1CA,1CG, 1OA)
, 
more specifically in the non
-ayacut areas where the high water consuming crops dominated and alternately 
in the ayacut areas
 with higher cropping intensity ranging f
rom 110 to 133 per cent
. This warrant
s optimizing 
the current cro
pping plan for simultaneous increase in net income 
while reducing
 the pressure on ground 
water use.

       16  It could
 also
 be 
seen that
 the 
area under 
rabi season paddy 
decreased by about 62 per cent 
while 
a 83 per 
cent increase 
was noticed 
in kharif season paddy over current plan but
 overall
, the 
total 
paddy area has 
reduced from 0.58 
lakh
 ha to 0.42  
lakh 
ha. 
The paddy area rather evened out between the kharif and rabi 
seasons. The decline was more pronounced in the non
-ayacut HLUs, particularly in the greater ground water 
deficit ones. 
Among the other HWC crops, area
 under sugarcane and banana declined by 6
1.00 and 
16.97
 per 
cent respectively, while that of turmeric increased marginally by 
8.09
 per cent
 which 
may be due to higher 
net benefits
. Among the low 
water consuming crops, there was a marginal reduction in area under maize by 
9.50
 per cent, 
whereas
 area under crops like, groundnut, gingelly, cotton
 and tapioca increased considerably 
ranging from
 35.93 per cent to 154.60 per cent. In the case of ragi, tobacco, onion, sunflower
 and vegetables 
namely, 
brinjal, chilies and tomato, the increase was substan
tial ranging from 409.40 to 2369.14 per cent.
 Under rain fed conditions
, area under groundnut, 
grain sorghum, fodder sorghum,
 and pulses declined in the 
range of 12.96 to 76.05 per cent, whereas, area under gingelly, cotton and maize increased between 96.5
7 and 110.96 per cent. 
The inference is shift from high water consuming and rain fed crops to low water 
consuming and commercial crops including vegetables. 
A comparison of table 3 and table 4 would also show 
that the cropping intensity declined in the cri
tical, semi critical and over exploited HLUs
, whereas it increased 
in the safe HLUs. The CLUI also shown a decline in the critical and over exploited HLUs in terms of ground 
water, while overall it showed a marginal increase. All these are sign of a crop s
et that will sustain resource 
base and simultaneously help to increase the farm income substantially. 
 4 Conclusion and policy implication 
 The static land use model was developed with an intension to identify an alternative cropping plan which 

would take 
care of the land and water resource use sustainability besides maximizing net income from crop 

enterprise in 
the 
Bavani basin of the 
western zone of Tamil Nadu
 in southern India
. The land use model use
d the spatial variation in biophysical and socio
-economic variables of a region by incorporating spatial 
attributes of land and water resources. The major biophysical factor considered are the land availability, 
ground and surface water availability, crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop se
quence and climatic 
variations 
in terms of the length of growing period, 
and these factors were specified as the constrain
ts in the 
land use model. The input data for the model 
were collected from 
the delineated 
HLUs
. The 
optimum 
land 
use model reveals tha
t there is possibility of increasing the crop income 
in the upper Bhavani basin of 
western zone of Tamil Nadu 
form current level of 
INR
 6.14 billion to 
INR
 8.25 b
illion
. This alternative crop 
plan also helped to reduce the area under high water consumi
ng crop
s in water deficit area 
without
 affecting 
the land and water resources base.
 Thus
, it could be revealed from the land and water resource efficiency 
indicator
s for the alternative crop plan
, 
resulted
 sustai
nable resource use with higher net income
, 
achie
ved 
through
 the static bio
-economic model.

AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT 
EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY Achievements and Challenges in Tamil Nadu Agriculture 
 (i) Agriculture in Tamil Nadu has enjoyed thre
e decades of growth based largely on 
rapid technological change. Food security has also increased due
 to rapid increases in food grain 
output, sales from the Public Distribution System (supplied by Food Corporation of India stocks), 
targeted feeding and employment programs, and we
ll-functioning rice markets that have enabled  
price-stabilizing inflows of rice from neighboring 
states in years of local production shortfalls. 
Partly because of agricultural growth, rural pove
rty rates declined from 38.5 percent to 24.3 
percent between 1993/94 and 1999/2000 (Deaton a
nd Drèze estimates). The state™s agriculture 
has a strong base for continued growth in term
s of a strong agricultural research system, an 
extensive road network, and a relatively well-educated rural labor force.  
(ii) While agricultural sector growth rates in Tamil Nadu were among the highest in 
India during the 1980s and early 1990s, decelerati
on in growth since the mid-1990s is of 
increasing concern to policymakers
. During the 1980s agricultural GSDP grew at 3.4 percent, 
exceeding the all-India agricultural growth of 2.9 
percent. Adequate rainfall contributed to even 
higher growth in the early 1990s: between 1989/90 
and 1994/95 agriculture grew by 7.2 percent 
in Tamil Nadu, compared with 3.1 percent in 
all of India. But between 1994/95 and 1999/2000 
agriculture in Tamil Nadu suffered from severe cons
ecutive droughts and grew only 1.3 percent a 
year, compared with 2.9 percent for all of India. 
As a result, the state™s agricultural growth rate 
during the 1990s was only 2.9 percent a year, compared with 3.2 percent for all of India.  
(iii) Faster growth in agriculture is central to rural development and poverty reduction 
in Tamil Nadu. Although agriculture accounts for only 15.7 percent of total GSDP, farm income 
accounts for about half of household income for 35 million people (56 percent of the state™s 
population) who live in rural areas. Much of this 
rural population is poor, with estimates ranging 
from 7.4 million people (20.6 percent of the rural 
population) to 11.4 million (31.8 percent of the 
rural population). For the poorest rural quintile 
(approximately 1.5 million households, or 7.5 
million people), more than three-quarters of income
 is derived from agriculture, with agricultural 
wage labor alone accounting for half of household income. Given the importance of agriculture in 
the incomes of the poor in Tamil Nadu, growth in
 labor-intensive agriculture could further reduce 
rural poverty through higher yields to small produ
cers, higher real wages to agricultural laborers, 
and increased income and employment opportunities with forward and backward links to the rural 

nonfarm sector.    
(iv) Traditional sources of growth in agricultu
re face major constraints such as growing 
water scarcity, increasing land degradation, dec
lining farm sizes, and rising costs of labor
. Tamil Nadu is one of the driest states in India, 
averaging only 925 millimeters of rainfall a year. 
The state™s dry season lasts five months (January through May) even in good years, and severe 
droughts occur in 3 of 10 years, severely lim
iting cultivation of crops between June and 
September. Per capita availability of water res
ources in Tamil Nadu is only 900 cubic meters a 
year, compared with 2,200 cubic meters for a
ll of India. Irrigation through a combination of 
canals, wells, and tanks
1 increases the reliability and availab
ility of water for farming and is 
                                                     
 1 A tank is a small-scale surface water reservoir constr
ucted on a gentle slope, designed so that water flows 
out of the tank through the force of gravity.  
 vessential for cultivating crops in much of the state.
 But the seasonality and scarcity of supply limit 
cultivation to only one crop per plot for most of the state.
2 The agricultural sector faces increasing 
competition for water from industry and domestic 
users and intensifying interstate competition 
for surface water resources. In many parts of the 
state, the rate of extraction of groundwater has 
exceeded recharge rates, contributing to falling 
water tables. Water quality is also a growing 
concern. Effluents discharged from industries and 
heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers have had 
a major impact on surface water quality, soils, and groundwater.   
(v) Agricultural land resources have also come
 under increasing pressure because of 
rapid population growth and urbanization
. Between 1971/72 and 1997/98 the available 
cultivable land per rural resident declined fro
m 0.22 hectares per capita to 0.15 hectares per 
capita. The growing pressures on land, skewed 
pricing policies, and rural poverty have all 
contributed to land and soil degradation. As a r
esult, poor soil fertility, salinity, water logging, 
overgrazing, and deforestation are growing pr
oblems and pose serious constraints to the 
performance of the agricultural sector
 in some parts of the state. (vi) Seasonal labor shortages and rising real agricultural wages during the past two 
decades, in part caused by rapid rural-urban migration, have contributed to higher incomes 
for agricultural laborers, but make future agric
ultural growth more difficult by reducing 
the competitiveness of Tamil Nadu™s agriculture vis-à-vis other agricultural producers
. Higher labor costs, due in part to rapid growth in demand for nonagricultural labor, have 
increased the cost of cultivation, especially fo
r labor-intensive crops. In 1999Œ2000 rural wages 
for male agricultural labor in the kharif season in
 Tamil Nadu averaged Rs.62.2 a day, compared 
with only Rs.45.3 a day in Andhra Pradesh and 
Rs.42.8 in Karnataka. These higher labor costs 
encourage mechanized land preparation and harves
ting, but small farm sizes constrain the rate of 
mechanization. 
(vii) Given the constraints, diversification 
into higher value, less water-intensive 
products, such as fruits, vegetables, spices, a
nd livestock products, may be one of the most 
promising sources of agricultural growth
. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions are well 
suited for diversified agricultu
re. Rapidly increasing incomes a
nd changing patterns of food 
demand also provide strong impetus for diversifi
cation. Increased agricultural diversification and private investments in processing for many of
 the higher value agricultural commodities are 
likely to generate new rural nonfarm employment
 opportunities and contribute to higher rural 
incomes.  (viii) Against this background this study assess
es agricultural policies in Tamil Nadu and 
the implications of these policies for future 
agricultural growth, food security, and rural 
poverty reduction, and recommends reform options
. This report focuses on selected critical 
issues rather than a comprehensive review of the 
agricultural sector in the 
state. It analyzes the 
structure of the agricultural economy, water ma
nagement, agricultural subsidies, agricultural 
marketing and regulations, and implications of 
policy reforms for food security and consumption 
of the poor.  

The Structure of Agriculture in Tamil Nadu 
(ix) Rice dominates both food consumption and agricultural production
, accounting for about a third of total gross cropped area and near
ly 60 percent of irrigated area in Tamil Nadu 
(over 90 percent of paddy is irrigated). Pul
ses (18 percent of total cropped area), millet (11 
percent), and groundnuts (10 percent) require less water than rice or sugar cane, and millet and 
pulses are grown almost exclusively on nonirrigated 
land. About 5 percent of total cropped area is 
                                                     
 2 In 1998/99 average cropping intensity was only 1.20 in Tamil Nadu, compared with 1.34 for all of India. 
 videvoted to sugar cane, all of it irrigated (acc
ounting for almost 10 percent of irrigated land). 
Cotton occupies about 3 percent of cropped area, and 
about a third of the cotton crop is irrigated.  
(x) The livestock and fisheries subsectors are also important in Tamil Nadu
. The state 
ranks second among Indian states in egg 
production and ninth in milk production.
3 In 2001/02 
Tamil Nadu accounted for approximately 6 percen
t of national milk production and 11.9 percent 
of egg production. The state is also relatively 
well endowed with fisheries, accounting for 13.2 
percent of total marine fish production and 4 percen
t of in-land fish production in India. In all, 
crop agriculture, livestock, and animal husbandry acc
ount for 92.2 percent of total value added in 
agriculture and allied activities, with fishing 
accounting for 4.5 percent and forestry for 3.3 percent. (xi) The average size of individually held farms is
 only 0.91 hectares, with over half the 
farms smaller than 0.5 hectares
. Nearly three-quarters of farms are smaller than 1 hectare, 
accounting for only 30.2 percent total cultivable land.
 In comparison, the average farm size in 
India is 1.41 hectares, with 62 percent 
of farmers holding less than 1 hectare. 
 
Water for Agriculture 
 (xii) Agriculture is the single largest consumer of
 water in the state, using 75 percent of 
the state™s water
. Despite limited water resources, Tamil Nadu has a high percentage of net sown 
area that is irrigated (54 percent). In 1999/2000 
the state had a net irrigated area of 3 million hectares. Today the state relies equally on surface 
and groundwater sources for irrigation, though 
its reliance on groundwater has been steadily in
creasing. Approximately 30 percent of the net 
irrigated area is watered by canals and 21 percent 
by tanks, while 49 percent is fed by wells. The 
remaining area is irrigated by other sources such as streams and springs. Rainfed agriculture, 
employing approximately 25 percent of farmers, accounts for 46 percent of the net sown area of 

5.5 million hectares. 
Institutional Issues 

(xiii) Institutional weaknesses have undermined 
proper management and development of 
water resources in the state
. As is common in many Indian states, inadequate priority to and 
funding for operations and maintenance led to ra
pid deterioration of surface irrigation. There was 
also minimal involvement of farmers in the opera
tions and maintenance of irrigation systems. But 
recent efforts have been made to address many
 of the issues plaguing the water sector.  
(xiv) The Government of Tamil Nadu is now undertaking 
comprehensive water planning on 
a river basin basis
 and has decentralized water resource management along river basins. In 1995 
the Public Works Department was divided into the 
Water Resources Organization
 (WRO) and 
the Buildings Organization. The WRO is to be fo
rmalized in 2004 as a separate agency with a 
specialized cadre of staff, with
 Chief Engineers reorganized around river basins. The Palar Basin 
Development and Management Board and th
e Thambaraparani Basin Development and 
Management Board were established in January 
of 2000. Preparation of macro-level basin 
development plans and formulation of deci
sion support systems for development and 
management of the water resources of the state have been under way since 1997. The state has 
drafted a Water Policy
, initiated steps for irrigation mana
gement transfer, and passed a 
Groundwater Regulation and Management Act, one of the first states in India to do so. The 
State Legislative Assembly passed the 
Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation 
                                                     
 3 Ranks are computed based on average production in Indian states between 1999 and 2001. 
 viiSystems Bill
 in May 2000. Substantial progress has been
 made in the environmental aspects of 
water resources development. 
(xv) Tamil Nadu has implemented a number of
 centrally sponsored and donor funded 
watershed development schemes to improve the 
production potential of rainfed agriculture
. The government recently launched the Comprehens
ive Wasteland Programme, which will cover 2 
million hectares through a watershe
d development project. Waters
hed projects in India have 
enjoyed relatively little success in curbing land degr
adation, improving the pr
oductivity of rainfed 
agriculture, and reducing rural poverty, and remain
 to be carefully evaluated in Tamil Nadu. 
 Economic Incentives for Water Use: Taxes and Implicit Subsidies  (xvi) Under the current system of economic incentive
s (prices, subsidies, taxes) the cost of 
water for farmers and other water users does 
not reflect the scarcity value (opportunity 
cost) of water. Throughout India, farmers using surface 
water for irrigation from canals or tanks 
are implicitly subsidized because water char
ges fall short of opera
tions and maintenance 
expenditures. Between 1990 and 2002 farmers usin
g groundwater for irrigation in Tamil Nadu 
also benefited from free agricultural power supply.
 Subsidizing irrigation water means that the 
environmental costs of water use are not bein
g internalized, reducing incentives for water 
conservation, encouraging the cultivation of 
water-intensive crops, and contributing to 
environmental degradation. The irrigation and ag
ricultural power subsidies have contributed to 
the state™s large fiscal deficit. These subsidies also 
have a high opportunity cost in terms of other 
social and economic expenditures foregone, 
and few poor directly benefit from them.  
(xvii) In 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu 
announced increases in irrigation water charges and reintroduced a tariff for agricultural power consumers
. These reformsŠ
charging for water on a per area basis (as is the case for surface irrigation) or on a flat rate basis 
(for agricultural power consumers)Šwere a step in 
the right direction. But even these reforms did 
not result in economically efficient pricing, becau
se the marginal cost for water was almost zero 
and thus demand for irrigation water was not affected. 
(xviii) Prior to 2003, water charges were levied 
by the Government of Tamil Nadu at a 
base rate (which varied according to crop, season, and soil quality) plus an additional 
charge equivalent to six times the base rate
. This additional charge was transferred to the local 
panchayats. Beginning in July 2003, an additi
onal water charge of Rs.150 per hectare was 
imposed, de-linked from any additional cess. Thus, farmers were to pay the original charge plus 
the Rs.150 per hectare. In addition, the FMIS Ac
t empowered water user associations to charge 
users between Rs.250 and Rs.500 per hectare. This fee could be retained by the associations for 
operation and maintenance of the systems turned over to them. 
(xix) The agricultural power tariff introduced in 2003 included a flat rate for unmetered 
connections of Rs.250 per horsepower a year
 and Rs.0.20 per kilowatt-hour for metered 
connections. Along with the reintroduction of the agricultural power tariff, the government 
announced an income support scheme for smallholde
rs and marginal farmers. Under the income 
support scheme, the Government of Tamil Nadu 
was to provide smallholders and marginal 
farmers a transfer of up to Rs.1,250 a year. This
 was a significant step toward creating a more 
direct and transparent system of subsidies to 
farmers and other target groups and ensuring the 
separation of commercial operation of the power u
tility from the need for subsidy. However, the 
reintroduction of agriculture power tariff became
 a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu during 
the recent national election, forcing the governme
nt which suffered severe electoral loss for the 
national parliament seats to reverse the policy. 
 viii (xx) Nonetheless, the analysis in this report su
ggests that introduction of a flat rate 
charge of Rs.250 a year for a five horsepower pu
mpset would have only a small effect on net 
returns to land and management, reducin
g them by only 4.9 to 6.5 percent
. Costs of crop cultivation using well irrigation would rise by only
 Rs.625 per hectare (annual charge pro-rated 
for one season) to Rs.1,250 per hectare (for sugar cane grown over eleven months). 
(xxi) Raising electricity charges to the estimated 
marginal economic price of electricity to 
agriculture of Rs.3.1 per kilowatt-hour, thou
gh, would increase irrigation costs to about 
Rs.4,600 per hectare for paddy and sugar cane
, reducing returns to land and management 
by 35.9 percent for paddy  and by 23.8 percent for sugar cane
. Likewise, total returns to land, 
labor, and capital (value added) would fall sharply 
for paddy and sugar cane irrigated by wells if 
farmers bore the cost of electricity for pumping, strengthening the case for a compensating 
income support scheme in this scenario.   
Other Public Expenditures on Agriculture and Food 
 (xxii) Although public expenditures on agriculture in Tamil Nadu are high, the quality of 
expenditures is a cause for concern
. Expenditures on agriculture, 
allied activities, and irrigation as a share of agricultural GSDP are higher in Tami
l Nadu than in most major agricultural states in 
India (World Bank 2003). Between 1998 and 2000 pub
lic expenditures on agriculture equaled 11 
percent of total agricultural GSDP in Tamil Nadu,
 compared with 7.8 percent in all of India.
4 Public agricultural capital expenditures in the state are relatively low compared with the all-India 
average, while the opposite is true of revenue (i.e. 
current) expenditures  as a share of agricultural 
GSDP. This is a situation for concern since capita
l investments are important for future growth. 
Furthermore, a large share of revenue expenditu
res are incurred on staff salaries, and  food and 
irrigation subsidies, leaving operating expenses under funded. Gross fixed capital formation in 
agriculture increased by 15 percent during the 1
990s, due primarily to private capital formation, 
which accounted for 88 percent of gross fixed capital formation in agriculture.  
(xxiii) The agricultural extension system in Tamil Nadu is still organized around a 
modified Training and Visit approach and 
continues to focus on major food-grains. There is little coordination among line departments (agricultu
ral, animal husbandry, fisheries) in their 
extension approach. The extension system is sl
owly changing, however, and the promotion of 
public-private partnerships in extension is en
couraging. The Government of Tamil Nadu also 
plans to link agricultural, horticultural, and agri
cultural engineering extension systems and units 
to improve the extension capacity fo
r horticultural development.   
(xxiv) Reforms of the public procurement system and improvements in targeting are 
reducing state expenditures on food subsidies
. The Government of Tamil Nadu estimates that 
the food subsidy will fall from Rs
.15 billion in 2001/02 to Rs.7 
billion in 2003/04. Cessation of 
local procurement (except on behalf of the 
Food Corporation of India) reduced government 
expenditures on procurement by an estimated Rs.6
.8 billion by eliminating the costs of paying 
extra procurement incentives and of milling the pa
ddy into rice. Additional savings came from 
reducing the subsidy per kilogram of rice sold 
and the number of cards (and ultimately the sales 
of rice). The total estimated reduction in subsidy (from both reforms on procurement and

itures on Economic Servi
ces and Agricultural GSDP

 ixdistribution) was about Rs.9.92 billion, with about
 two-thirds due to the cessation of Government 
of Tamil Nadu procurement on its own behalf. 
Development of Agricultural Markets 
 (xxv) In the past decade Tamil Nadu has in
creased private sector participation in 
marketing and eliminated government restrictions
. Unlike most Indian states, where 
wholesale marketing is restricted to regulated markets, Tamil Nadu permits traders to transact 
sales outside of regulated markets. Private market
s account for about 90 percent of the statewide 
trade in major crops. Regulated markets, in whic
h licensed traders bid for farmer produce through 
a tender system, account for only 10 percent.  
(xxvi) In May 2003, following the February 
2002 central Government order removing 
licensing restrictions on rice and 13 other crops, the state Government withdrew its 
licensing system for these crops
. Restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking, and sales of 
these commodities have been removed, though
 some provision remains for Government intervention in the case of high market prices for 
goods distributed through the public distribution 
system.  
(xxvii) Greater private sector participation in mark
ets has enhanced food security in Tamil 
Nadu. Increases in state production of major stap
les (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice 
through the public distribution system, school feeding programs, and targeted relief 
programs have increased access to food
. During the drought of 2002/03 the wholesale prices of 
rice only rose 2.8 percent in real terms above th
e previous year™s prices despite a 34 percent fall 
in paddy production in the state. This was 
because private sector inflows from neighboring 
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and the availability 
of rice through the public distribution system 
helped to maintain access to food for poor consumers. 
(xxviii) Private investments in processing and marketing horticultural and export crops have 
enjoyed some success (for example, tumeric exports from Erode). Contract farming involving 
business agreements for the purchase of outputs and 
often the provision of inputs and extension advice is increasing, particularly for sugarcane, cotton, and horticultural crops.   Policy Reform Options in Tamil Nadu™s Agriculture 
 (xxix) Reducing rural poverty, accelerating growth in agricultural production, and 
overcoming the constraints faced by the agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu require 
appropriate policies and investments in four priority areas
: improving the efficiency of water 
use, increasing the effectiveness of public expend
itures and agricultural extension, spurring the 
development of agricultural markets, and maximizi
ng the real income growth of the rural poor.  
 Improving the Efficiency of Water Use 
 (xxx) Long-term growth in agriculture and rural 
incomes depends in large part on using 
water efficiently
. Water management options include scaling up the pilot river basin framework 
for managing water resources holistically, allowi
ng interagency coordina
tion and public-private 
partnerships; introducing specific, legally enfor
ceable water entitlements to various users in a 
river basin and or aquifer framework; adjusting el
ectricity, water, and crop prices to change the 
 xfinancial incentives for irrigation and crop choice; and improving management practices and 
irrigation technologies (such as drip and sprinkler
 irrigation) and investing in canals and water 
storage (coupled with improved operation and maintenance). 
 (xxxi) Public administration in the water sect
or could be improved by separating 
responsibilities for water resource man
agement and irrigation service delivery
. Tamil Nadu 
is the only state in India without a separate departme
nt of irrigation, now a 
part of the Department of Public Works. Two new agencies are needed: a 
regulatory agency to allocate the share of water 
resources to agriculture, industry, and other uses,
 and an irrigation department focusing on irrigation delivery systems. A separate irrigati
on department would allow for the creation of a 
specialized cadre of irrigation specialists, instead
 of the current setup that relies on staff from the 
Department of Public Works (which also includes administration of public buildings).  

(xxxii) Irrigation management transfer is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and water user 
associations are not yet fully functional
. The transfer of irrigation management to farmers in 
line with the FMIS Act should be expedited to
 make water distribution more efficient and equitable.  
(xxxiii) Providing the right economic incentives (pric
es, subsidies, taxes) that recognize the 
opportunity cost of water is essential
 for improving water use efficiency. Raising electricity 
charges to the estimated marginal economic price 
of electricity to agriculture of Rs.3.1 per 
kilowatt-hour may not be politically feasible, but moving gradually toward marginal cost pricing 
(perhaps combined with compensation to farmers 
in the form of income transfers or a more 
reliable electricity supply) would help rationa
lize water use in Tamil Nadu. Paying greater 
attention to market infrastructure, strengthening
 research and extension to meet the needs of 
diversified agriculture, developing tools for fa
rmers to better manage 
risks, and improving 
irrigation pumpset efficiency are likely to make hi
gher power charges more palatable to farmers.  
If farmers™ costs and incomes varied according to 
the amount of electricity (and water) used with 
well irrigation, they would have an incentive to
 shift some land from water-intensive crops (rice 
and sugar cane) toward less water-intensive crops
 (including cotton, maize, and vegetables).  
(xxxiv) Increases in electricity charges would have
 little effect on overall rice production 
and market prices but a major effect on sugar cane production
. Since only about 10 percent 
of rice area cultivated is irrigated with well 
water (about 200 thousand hectares), changes in 
electricity pricing would have only marginal eff
ects on production. And since rice is also supplied 
by net public distribution (averaging 1.2 million t
ons a year from 1997/98 to 2001/02, 18 percent 
of net production) and private market trade from 
neighboring states (estimated at 1.0Œ1.3 million 
tons in the drought year 2002/03), the effect of
 lower rice production from well  irrigated areas on 
market prices of rice would likely be small.
 Impacts on sugar cane production would be much 
greater, however, as essentially all sugar cane is irrigated in part with well water.  
(xxxv) The current provisions for irrigation wat
er charges allow full cost recovery of required operations and maintenance expenditures
. The extent to which farmers are actually 
being charged the proposed water rates remains unclear.  

(xxxvi) Greater attention is also needed for 
modernizing irrigation infrastructure and 
scaling up the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies. While the use of sprinkler and 
drip technology has been promoted in the stat
e, the high capital cost of these technologies 
constrains widespread adoption by smallholde
rs and marginal farmers. More affordable 
technology or a suitable system of targeted subs
idies should be developed to increase the use of 
sprinkler and drip systems. 
 xi(xxxvii) Past experience reveals that extensive community participation with sound technical 
inputs are necessary for successful watershed programs. 
A basin perspective should be adopted 
to ensure that these initiatives do not have
 negative impacts on downstream human and 
ecological uses.   Increasing the effectiveness of public 
expenditures and agricultural extension  (xxxviii) Responding to the needs of diversified
 agriculture requires a highly effective 
research and agricultural extension system
. An assessment of the state™s comparative 
advantage in producing higher value crops for the 
domestic and export markets would also help 
in setting future research and development prioriti
es.  Re-orienting agricultural research to make 
it more farmer-responsive would likewise improve the output of a system that has enjoyed much 
success in rice technology development in the past. 
Similarly, the current extension system in the 
state remains organized around a modified Training and Visit approach and continues to be 
highly focused on major food-grains, though the pr
omotion of public-private partnerships in 
extension is a very encouraging recent  devel
opment and offers potential for both cost-savings 
and greater efficiency. Thus, it is recommende
d that the GoTN develop a new agricultural 
extension strategy to meet the changing needs 
of farmers. This could include adopting an 
integrated and decentralized extension system th
at could help build farmer organizations that 
could link with private firms to increase economic growth in rural areas.   
(xxxix) Rationalizing public expenditures and shi
fting expenditures from subsidies to 
investments in key public goods such rural 
roads, markets and agricultural research and 
extension will facilitate productivity improve
ments and diversification of agriculture to higher value products
. Tightening competition for limited fiscal resources heightens the urgency 
of appropriate public expenditure reallocati
on. Institutional reforms within government 
departments to ensure improved quality of deliver
y of rural-related public goods and services is 
also important.
 Promoting the development of well 
functioning agricultural markets  (xl) Well functioning agricultural markets are al
so important for successful agricultural 
diversification. If recent policy reforms removing restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking 
and sales of paddy and 13 other crops are consisten
tly implemented at the local level, they can be 
expected to improve marketing efficiency
, reducing the margin between producer and 
consumer/export prices. Reductions in marketing 
costs are also necessary in order for production 
increases to lead to higher agricu
ltural incomes, particularly for perishable high-value products 
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, animal products). Contr
act farming and other private sector initiatives 
should be encouraged, though the impact of
 these business arrangements on farmer incomes 
should be evaluated, as well . 
(xli) There remain, however, important roles for the public sector in promoting agro-
food system and agro-enterprise development
  In addition to policies that establish ﬁrules of 
the gameﬂ and address market failures, public i
nvestments in rural roads to strengthen rural 
connectivity can contribute to reduced costs 
of marketing.  Although Tamil Nadu has an 
extensive road network, further attention to ma
intenance and upgrading of rural roads in some 
regions may be warranted.  Given the rapidly cha
nging nature of markets in Tamil Nadu, an in-
depth study of market structure and investment needs would be useful.   
 xii(xlii) Increasing agricultural diversification will not compromise Tamil Nadu™s food 
security objectives given an effective PDS , we
ll-functioning markets and targeted nutrition 
programs
.  Greater food security has largely been 
achieved through increases in state production of major staples (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice through the PDS, school feeding 
programs, and targeted relief programs during droughts. During the recent drought of  2002/03 
the wholesale prices of rice only rose 2.8 percent (in real terms) above the previous year™s price, 

despite a 34 percent fall in paddy production in th
e state, helping to maintain access to food for 
poor consumers. This was largely due to privat
e sector inflows from neighboring states of Andhra 
Pradesh and Karnataka and the ava
ilability of rice through the PDS. 
 Maximizing Real Income Growth for the Poor 
 (xliii) Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor
.  Increased availability of water and great
er efficiency of water use in the dry 
season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops 
remains an important unresolved issue, however.  Contract farming may help overcome these 

problems, if competition between firms helps farmers 
maintain their share of the value of the final 
product sales.  The experience of Latin America 
and the Caribbean suggests that education, 
transport infrastructure, and engines of non-farm
 growth that promote female employment are 
key aspects of a success strategy to promote non-farm growth and rural poverty reduction. 
(xliv) Whether agricultural diversification reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new 
technologies and have access to markets, the 
magnitude of employment and real wage rate gains, and the size of linkage effects with 
rural non-agriculture. The implications of an agricultura
l diversification strategy involving 
higher risk crops and capital-intensive technologies (drip irrigation) must be assessed. This 
assessment should review crop and drought insu
rance instruments, and the potential for 
innovations in these instruments to enable rural fa
rmers, particularly poor farmers, to better 
manage risks.   10100200300400500600

AGRICULTURAL DEVEL0PMENT
 1. Introduction  1.1 The agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu has a 
long history of notable achievements 
and significant progress.  Construction of the Grand Anicut (dam) on the Cauvery river in the 
second century AD permitted a large expansion of
 irrigated area and rice cultivation, and a 
flourishing of the Chola kingdom.  Centuries 
later, rapid expansion of green revolution 
technology (improved seeds, increased fertilizer use,
 and irrigation) enabled the state to increase 
average rice yields by 74.4 percent between 
the trienniums ending 1972/73 and 2001/02, enabling 
production to increase by 36.2 percent in spite of 
a 21.9 percent decrease in
 area cultivated with rice.   1.2 While agricultural sector growth rates in Tamil Nadu were among the highest in 
India during the 1980s and early 1990s, decelerati
on in growth since the mid-1990s is of 
increasing concern to policymakers
. During the 1980s agricultural GSDP grew at 3.4 percent, 
exceeding the all-India agricultural growth of 2.9 
percent. Adequate rainfall contributed to even 
higher growth in the early 1990s: between 1989/90 
and 1994/95 agriculture grew by 7.2 percent 
in Tamil Nadu, compared with 3.1 percent in 
all of India. But between 1994/95 and 1999/2000 
agriculture in Tamil Nadu suffered from severe cons
ecutive droughts and grew only 1.3 percent a 
year, compared with 2.9 percent for all of India. 
As a result, the state™s agricultural growth rate 
during the 1990s was only 2.9 percent a year, compared with 3.2 percent for all of India. 

1.3 In contrast to the uneven growth in agriculture, the non-agricultural economy of 
Tamil Nadu has expanded rapidly, leading to a sh
arp decline in the share of agriculture in total output (
Figure  1.1).  The agricultural and allied services 
(livestock, forestry and fisheries) 
sector™s contribution to GSDP has declined fro
m 24.3 percent in 1980/81 to 15.7 percent in 
2001/02, one of the lowest shares in the country. By comparison, between 1980/81 and 2001/02 
the services sectors share of GSDP increased from 
40.7 percent to 51.5 percent, while the share of 
industry decreased slightly, from 35 percent to 32.8 percent.

 21.4 Despite its declining importance in th
e overall economy, however, agriculture remains a major source of employmen
t and earnings for the rural poor.  About  56 percent 
of the state™s population of 62 million (2001 Census) 
resides in rural areas and close to half (14.4 
million workers) of an estimated 29 million workers are employed in agriculture (
Table  1.1).  For 
the poorest rural quintile (approximately 1.5 milli
on households with about 7.5 million people), 
more than three-quarters of income continues to
 be derived from agriculture, with agriculture 
wage labor alone accounting for half of house
hold income. Agricultural labor accounts for 49.5 
percent of the labor force in the state, less than the all-India average of 59.2 percent.  Unlike most 
of India (with the exception of Andhra Pradesh), 
agricultural laborers outnumber cultivators by a 
1.69:1 ratio (compared with a 0.88:1 ration across 
India), further highlighting the importance of 
returns to labor for poverty reduction.

 1.5 Agricultural growth has played a major role
 in rural poverty reduction in the past 
in Tamil Nadu, and could make subs
tantial contributions in the future.  Analysis based on 
household surveys indicates that the spread of green revolution technology in the 1970s and 
1980s contributed to sizeable increases in returns to
 land, raising farmer™s incomes.  Increasing 
demand for goods and services by farm households fu
rther stimulated expansion of the rural non-
farm economy contributing to poverty reduction. 
Although rural poverty rates declined by 6.7-
14.2 percent (depending on the definition of 
the poverty line), between 1993/94 and 1999/00, 
there remain between 7 and 11 million rural poor 
in Tamil Nadu (1999/00 data), 21-32 percent of 
the rural population.  Increases in agricultural 
production, processing and trade could enable further declines in rural poverty.    
 3  Fostering Agricultural Growth in Tamil Nadu 
 1.6 Yields of major crops in Tamil Nadu are among the highest in India, but 
productivity growth has slowed in recent years
. By the late 1990s, yields of major crops grown 
in Tamil Nadu including paddy, sugar cane, cotton and groundnut were among the highest across 
major Indian states.  In 1998-99, Tamil Nadu 
had the highest rice, sugar cane and groundnut 
yields in India and cotton yields in the state were second only to Gujarat.  Increases in yields 
enabled land productivity to grow by 6.1 per
cent per year between 1987/88 and 1993/94 from Rs 
16,423/ha to Rs 23,459/ha (in constant 93/94 Rs),
 but by only 2.4 percent per year between 
1993/94 and 1999/00 (to Rs 27,099/ha in constant
 93/94 Rs).  Likewise, average labor 
productivity in agriculture increased by an aver
age of 4.6 percent per year between 1987/88 and 
1993/94 from Rs 6,881 per worker to Rs 9,024 per 
worker (in constant 93/94 Rs), but by only 2.4 
percent per year between 1993/94 and 1999/00  to 
Rs 10,434 per worker (in constant 93/94 Rs).  
1.7 Traditional sources of agricultural growth
 face major constraints including growing 
water scarcity, increasing land degradation and 
declining farm sizes, and rising costs of 
agricultural labor. Tamil Nadu is one of the driest states 
in India, with an average of only 925 
millimeters of rainfall per year. The state has a 
dry season that extends over five months of the 
year (January through May) even in good years, and severe droughts occur in three out of every 
ten years severely limiting cultivation of crops betw
een the months of June and September.  The 
per capita availability of water resources of Tam
il Nadu is only 900 cubic meters compared to an 
all-India average of 2200 cubic meters per a
nnum. Irrigation through a combination of canals, 
tanks,5 and wells, increases the reliability and availability of water for farming, and is essential 
for successful cultivation of crops in much of the 
state.  Nonetheless, seasonality of supply and 
scarcity of water limit cultivation to only 
one crop per plot for most of the state.
6  In addition to growing water scarcity, the agricultural sector
 faces increasing competition for water from 
industries and domestic users and intensifying inte
rstate competition for surface water resources. 
In many parts of the state, the rate of extr
action of groundwater has exceeded recharge rates contributing to falling water tables. Water quality issues are also of increasing concern. Effluents 
discharged from industries as well
 as heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers have had a major 
impact on surface water quality, soils and groundwater.     
1.8 Agricultural land resources have also come
 under increasing pressure because of 
rapid population growth and increasing urbanization
. The available cultivable land per rural 
resident has declined from 0.22 ha/capita to 
0.15 ha/capita between 1971/72 and 1997/98. The 
growing pressures on land coupled with skew
ed pricing policies and rural poverty have 
contributed to land and soil degradation. As a r
esult, poor soil fertility, salinity, water logging, 
over grazing, and deforestation are growing pr
oblems and pose serious constraints to the 
performance of the agricultural sector
 in some parts of the state.  1.9 Solid growth in agricultural output and employment, rapid growth in the non-
agricultural sector, and rural-urban migration have all contributed to rising real 
agricultural wages over the past two decades.  
These higher returns to labor have contributed 
                                                     
 5 A tank is a manmade small-scale surface water reserv
oir on a gentle slope, designed so that water may 
flow out of the tank through the force of gravity.  
6 Average cropping intensity in Tamil Nadu is only
 1.20, compared to 1.34 (1998-99) for all-India. 
 4to the state™s success in raising rural incomes 
and reducing rural povert
y, though unemployment 
in the dry season remains a major factor underl
ying low incomes of poor rural households.  
 1.10 However, high real agricultural wages a
nd seasonal labor shortages have also 
increased the costs of cultivation, and tended 
to reduce the competitiveness of Tamil Nadu 
agriculture vis-à-vis other states and in international markets.  
Rural daily wage rates for 
male agricultural labor in the kharif season in 
Tamil Nadu in 1999-2000 averaged 62.2 Rs/day, 
compared with only 45.3 and 42.8 Rs/day in
 Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively (
Table  1.1).  These higher labor costs have spurred m
echanization of some operations, including field 
preparation and rice harvesting, but small farm
 sizes constrain the rate of mechanization. 
 1.11 Faced with these constraints, the Governme
nt has adopted a strategy of agricultural 
diversification to accelerate agricultural growth
. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions are 
well suited to diversified agriculture. Furthermor
e, rapidly increasing incomes and changing food 
demand patterns provide strong impetus for 
diversification. The Government™s 10
th plan articulates a strategy to reinvigorate agricultura
l growth through improved productivity, higher 
cropping intensities, diversification and increasi
ng commercialization. Efficient land and water management underlie the proposed strategy for grow
th in agriculture. The Government™s recently 
announced approach to diversifying agriculture 
includes area expansion through the development 
of waste and fallow lands and crop substitution by further developing the horticultural sector. 
Emphasis is also placed on improving the productivit
y of water through the promotion of drip and 
sprinkler irrigation technology and improved irrigation practices.   
1.12 In spite of some promising recent steps, 
current price incentives do not promote 
efficient water and land resource use, and the 
research and extension system remains better 
suited for technology for traditional crops
. Existing input subsidies for power, water and 
fertilizer distort incentives for diversification and su
stainable use of natural resources. Further, the agricultural research and extension is not yet in
 a position to respond to the new demands of   
diversified agriculture. With its relatively edu
cated rural labor force and growing manufacturing 
sector, Tamil Nadu is well poised to capture the be
nefits of rural non-farm growth stimulated by 
both upstream and down stream linkages 
with diversified agriculture.   Plan of the Report 
 1.13 Against this background the objectives of
 this study are to assess agricultural 
policies in Tamil Nadu and the implications of
 these policies for future agricultural growth, 
food security and rural poverty reduction, and to recommend reform options
.  This report focuses on selected critical issues related to agricultural growth in
 Tamil Nadu, rather than a 
comprehensive review of the agricultural sector in 
the state. The analysis focuses on the structure 
of the agricultural economy, water management, 
agricultural subsidies, agricultural marketing 
and regulations, and implications
 of policy reforms for food security and consumption of the 
poor.   1.14 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the structure of the agriculture sector and the rural 
economy, focusing on the major crops and cropping 
patterns, livestock and fisheries. Chapter 3 
examines the importance of water for agricultu
re.  Chapter 4 discusses public policies and 
agricultural research and extension issues.  
Chapter 5 focuses on agricultural markets and 
marketing policies. Chapter 6 discusses issues re
lated to food security and rural poverty. The 
conclusion and policy options are presented in Chapter 7.   

1.15 This paper is based on the missions™ discussions
 with various stakeholders, including the 
Government of Tamil Nadu, farmers, agricultural laborers, private sector representatives and 
academics.  This work also draws on a backgroun
d paper, ﬁPromoting Agricultural Development 
 5in Tamil Nadu:  Perspectives, Dimensions and Potentials,ﬂ prepared by a team of researchers at 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University led by Pr
ofessor C. Ramasamy.  The study complements 
other concurrent analytic work (particular, the 
papers on  poverty and investment climate) on 
Tamil Nadu. 
 62. Overview  2.1 Tamil Nadu™s agriculture, though dominated fo
r centuries by rice cultivation in river 
basins, varies considerably across the state™
s major agro-climatic zones.  Although water 
availability limits cultivation on most land to a 
single crop, technological change in agriculture 
has enabled increased yields and production over a 
wide range of crops.  Livestock sector growth, particularly poultry and dairy products, has also accelerated in the 1990s. 
Agro-climatic Zones of Tamil Nadu 
 2.2 Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones
 based on rainfall distribution, irrigation patterns, soil types, and other ecological characteristics (
Figure  2.1, 
Table  2.1).
7  The 
Cauvery Delta which forms its own agro-ecological
 zone, enjoys relatively high rainfall relative 
to most of Tamil Nadu (1101 millimeters per yea
r), and irrigation water through canals for six to 
seven months in good rainfall years in the catchme
nt area of the Cauvery river.  The Northeast, 
which includes Chennai, includes the Palar river basin and surrounding hillsides.  Sufficient 
concentrated rainfall and slow drainage enable
 irrigation from natural and man-made tanks.  
Average annual rainfall is slightly less in the 
North zone (849 millimeters); the western zone 
which receives very little rainfall from the southwest
 monsoon is the driest region, with only 714 
millimeters of average annual rainfall.
  Total rainfall in the Southern 
zone is similar to that of the 
north zone, but there are few large river basins, 
apart from the Tambraparni which flows south in 
Tirunelveli district.  The two remaining zones receive
 more rainfall than the rest of the state.  The 
High Rainfall zone, located in the southern tip of Tamil Nadu (Kanniyakum
ari district), receives 
heavy rainfall from the southwest monsoon, (annual 
average rainfall of 1457 millimeters).  In the 
Hilly zone that includes the mountains in Wester
n Tamil Nadu, (Nilgiris district and the western edge of several other districts), numerous types of tree crops are cultivated.

 7 Rainfall data in Table 2.2 and other data on area, yield and production of crops by agro-climatic zones are 
based on data for the districts indicated.  Thes
e figures are only approximate indicators of the 
characteristics of the zones, howe
ver, since actual boundaries of ag
ro-climatic zones do not coincide 
exactly with district  boundaries.   
 7 2.3 Rice is the major crop in the Cauvery delta zone and the Northeast zone, 
(52.4 and 42.3 percent of gross area cultivated, respectivel
y), but plays a smaller role in the farming 
systems of the drier Western and Northwestern zones
 (9.6 and 15.9 percent of gross area 
cultivated, respectively) (
Table  2.2).  In these latter areas, other cereals, (millets, sorghum and 
maize) account for 18.8 and 24.6 percent of gross 
area cultivated, respectively.  Cropping patterns 
are more diversified in the Western, South, and High Rainfall zones, where the share of crops 
other than cereals, pulses, sugar cane, cotton a
nd groundnuts, is 38.1, 27.9 and 46.2 percent, respectively.  Tree crops dominate the cropping patterns in the Hilly zone.

 2.4 Multiple cropping in Tamil Nadu is severely limited by the relatively low levels of 
rainfall, concentrated in only a few months of the year
.  Only one crop per year can be grown 
in the upland areas in most parts of the state. 
 Even in river valleys, 
water availability through 
 8surface irrigation in canals is sufficient for two cr
ops in only a few areas, and depends heavily on 
the extent and timing of the southwest monsoons. 
 Likewise, water availability through irrigation 
from tanks or wells is limited in the dry season. 
 Thus, although 55 percent of net area cultivated 
in Tamil Nadu is irrigated, the cropping intensity 
is only 1.2.  In the drier south region (zone 6), 
the cropping intensity is only 1.06 (Ramasamy et. al., 2003) . 
Major Crops  2.5 Rice dominates both agricultural production
 and food consumption, accounting for 
about one-third of total gross cropped area and 
nearly 60 percent of irrigated area in Tamil Nadu (Figure  2.2, Table  2.3). About 5 percent of total cropped area is devoted to sugar cane, all 
of it irrigated (accounting for almost 10 percent of irrigated land). Pulses (18 percent of total 
cropped area), millets (11 percent) and groundnuts 
(10 percent) require less water that rice or 
sugar cane, and, millets and pulses are grown al
most exclusively on non-irrigated land.  Cotton 
occupies only about 3 percent of cropped area; a
bout one third of the cotton crop is irrigated 
(Figure  2.3).  Water shortages, ample supplies of 
Food Corporation of India rice stocks, and 
potential for cultivation of higher value crops un
derlie the Tamil Nadu government™s policy of 
promoting crop diversification.

 9  2.6 In most of Tamil Nadu, a single rice cro
p is grown, planted some time between 
August and October in anticipation of the onset of the northeast monsoons and harvested 
four to five months later.8  In the Cauvery delta region, which accounted for 33 percent of rice 
area cultivated in 2001/02, two rice crops are grow
n on land where sufficient water is available. On about 120 thousand hectares of cultivated land, the 
kuruvai (June/July Œ October/November) 
rice crop is followed by 
thaladi (October/November Œ February/March) in the four major 
districts9.  On another 200-240 thousand hectares of land, there is generally insufficient water for 
two crops (because of drought or lack of canal water), and a single 
samba  crop (August-January) 
is grown. Total gross cultivated area of rice in 
these districts is thus 440-480 thousand hectares.
 10   2.7 Rice production increased rapidly in Tamil Nadu from the 1950s to the 1970s, as 
green revolution technology (high-yielding varieties, fertilizer, and irrigation) spread
.  Area 
planted to paddy in Tamil Nadu expanded by 
52.6 percent from 1.73 million hectares in 1950/51 
to an average of 2.64 million hectares in 1970s, in
 part due to increased well irrigation.  Yields 
also increased, from an average of 1.31 tons of 
paddy (in rice equivalent) in the 1950s to 1.94 
tons in the 1970s.  As a result, average producti
on in the 1970s was 87 percent higher than that of 
the 1950s (Rajagopalan, 2000).    
2.8 Area planted to paddy peaked in 1979/80 (2.906 million hectares), but has declined 
steadily since that time, from 2.82 million h
ectares for the triennium ending (TE)  in 
1979/80 to 2.13 million hectares fo
r the triennium ending in 2001/02 (a 24.4 percent decline 
in total).  Yield increased by 67.6 percent over the 
same period (from 2.02 to 3.39 tons/ha), more 
than outweighing the decline in area.  The most ra
pid period of yield growth occurred in the late 
1980s: from the triennium ending in 1985/86 to 1990/01, yields increased by 44.1 percent from 
2.14 to 3.08 tons/hectare.  Overall for the en
tire period (1979/80 to 2001/02), production of rice 
increased 26.7 percent, reaching a peak of 8.14 million tons in 1998/99.     
2.9 Sugar cane, with a duration of 11 months, is grown on land irrigated by canals and 
wells.11  About 10 percent of irrigated area is plante
d with sugar cane and the crop requires, on 
average 1800 millimeters of water per unit area cu
ltivated.  Given that a single crop remains in 
the field year-round, however, its 
total water use per crop per year
 is less than two crops of paddy, but still greater than any other crop.  
Over all, sugar cane, which accounted for 5.16 
percent of gross cropped area in 2000-2001 used an estimated 14.0 percent of irrigation water 
resources.  Sugar cane yields in Tamil Nadu (109 to
ns/ha) are the highest in India (all-India yield 
is 68 tonnes/ha).  Four-fifths of sugar cane is sold 
directly to sugar mills; the remainder is used to 
make jaggery (i.e. gur or unrefined sugar).  
Government support prices have maintained output 
price incentives for sugar production over time.  While
 real market prices for paddy have declined 
                                                     
 8 The timing of the cropping seasons shown here and elsewhere in this report are approximate, and vary 
somewhat across regions and according to
 the timing of the monsoon rains. 
9 Figures on crop area by season are for the four districts of the Cauvery delta as defined by the Department 
of Agriculture: Thiruchirapalli, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur,
 and Nagapattinam.  Two other districts, Karur and 
Perambular, districts are included in the Cauvery Delta 
agro-climatic zone in the tables in this report.  
10 See Hazell and Ramasamy (eds.), (1991) for a detailed description of cropping patterns in North Arcot 
(Vellore and Thiruvannamalai districts).    
11 A second 
ratoon
 crop, grown from the roots and base of the stalks from the first harvest, is cultivated on 
approximately 70-80 percent of the area planted to sugar cane.   
             Source: Ramasamy et. al, 2003
  10by an average of 4.8 percent per year from 1990 to 
2000, real prices of sugar cane have increased 
slightly over the same period (0.5 percent per year) (

 2.10 Cotton cultivation declined during the 1990s by 2.38 percent per year due to 
increased incidence of pests and diseases, the hi
gh cost of pesticides, and unstable output 
prices.  Cotton is cultivated throughout the state except 
in the high rainfall zones, with the largest 
concentration in the drier southern zone (
Table  2.5).   Although cotton requires less water than 
rice (about 600 millimeters per season), it is a 
longer duration crop (six months) than rice 
(generally 4 months).  Thus, cotton cultivation in
 most of Tamil Nadu requires some irrigation.  
 11Nonetheless, it does not grow well in water-l
ogged soils, making cotton cultivation difficult in 
canal systems with heavy soils and lack of wate
r control.  As a result, cotton cultivation is 
concentrated in the western zone, where irrigati
on in drier months is s
upplied by well water.  
Biological control methods that include intercroppi
ng of cotton with other plants have enabled a 
reduction in pesticide use in recent years.  Co
mmercial cultivation of genetically modified Bt 
cotton commenced in Tamil Nadu during 2002. (
Text Box  2.1).  Only about 50,000 tons of the 
600,000 tons of cotton lint used annually by 
the state™s textile factories (mainly around 
Coimbatore) are produced in the state; the bulk of
 the cotton lint derives from Maharashtra, other 
Indian states, and imports.

   122.11 Production of cholam (sorghum/jowar),
 cumbu (pearl millet/bajra), and ragi 
(mundua/finger millet) increased slightly in 
the 1980s, but declined in the 1990s,
 registering overall growth rates of -2.33, -2.05 and -1.02 pe
r cent respectively over the entire period.  These 
crops (included along with maize in the broad category of ﬁmilletsﬂ in Tamil Nadu), are grown 
almost exclusively on non-irrigated land, as cumbu 
and ragi are particularly drought tolerant.  
Often planted on non-irrigated land in December/
January after the northeast monsoon has ended, 
the crop survives on residual moisture and is harv
ested in the dry season (around April).  Shifts in 
food habits due to increased income and urba
nization have reduced demand for these crops, and 
real prices of cholam declined by 1.4 percent pe
r year over the 1980s and 1990s, despite the slow 
growth in production (
Table  2.4).      
Text Box  2.1:  Bt Cotton in Tamil Nadu 
  2.12 Maize production has increased very rapidly (by 8.25 percent per year) over the last 
two decades from just 20 thousand tons in 1980-81 to 118 thousand tons in 2001-02
, due to an increase in demand from the poultry and ot
her livestock feed industries. Production is 
concentrated in western and southern zones, the 
two zones with the lowest annual rainfall.  There 
has been little change in average yields, whic
h have hovered at about 1.6 tons/hectare. 
2.13     Groundnut production increased by 5.07 percent per year in the 1980s, but 
stagnated during the 1990s (declining by 0.50 percent year), due to a decline in area 
cultivated (Table  2.7).  Slack demand for groundnuts, reflected 
in an average decline in real 
market prices of 2.6 percent year in the 
1990s, has reduced producer incentives, as well (Table 
 2.4).  Nonetheless, yields have increased by an
 average of 3.32 percent over the 1980s and 1990s.  
Groundnuts require far less water than rice and do not
 perform well in water-logged soils, so they 
Genetically modified Bt cotton has been grown commercially in Tamil Nadu since 2002 and is 
currently the only biotech crop that has been approved for commercial cultivation in the state. Bt cotton 
contains the gene for Cry1AC which provides a high degree of resistance to the bollworm, a common 
pest whose larvae feed on cotton bolls. The technology introduced into India through a collaboration 
between Monsanto and the Maharashtra Hybrid 
Seed Company (Mahyco) 
received commercial 
approval in 2002 with farmers in Tamil Nadu harvesting their first crop of Bt cotton in 
January/February, 2003.   
 According to data from Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Ltd. (MMB) 295 farmers have planted Bt 
Cotton over an area of 374 hectares in Tamil Nadu.  Of the 925 packets of seed sold during the 2002 
Kharif crop, 745 were of the MECH 162 variety, with the remaining 180 being of the MECH 184 
variety
.    Early experience from the state indi
cates that pesticide use against bollworms dropped by 65-70 percent 
on most farms and farmers realized an average yield in
crease of 30 percent  (MMB).  As a result of the 
drought in Tamil Nadu last year the pest pressure wa
s low resulting in the Bt cotton crop faring fairly 
well in the state in comparison to other southern states which grew Bt cotton. Normally farmers spray 
8-10 times for controlling bollworms in their cotton crop.  As many as 15 sprays may be needed in 
some districts of Tamil Nadu.  Farmers cultivating Bollgard in 2002-03 managed their crop with a 

maximum of 4 sprays.  In most cases farmers only used 2-3 sprays in the Bollgard Cotton crop, 
compared to 6-8 sprays used in other commercial cotton crops. 
 
As pest related damage on cotton plots in India is fairly high (averaging 50-60 percent), the yield 
effects of Bt cotton in field trials in India have b
een larger than those observed in countries such as 
China and the United States where pest pressure is lower and farmers exhibit a higher rate of pesticide 
adoption.  It is still too early to assess the real 
success of Bt cotton in Tami
l Nadu.  Increasing bollworm 
resistance to Bt resulting from 
poor farm management practices 
is growing cause for concern. 
 13are typically grown from December through April,
 after the heavy monsoon rains.  Nonetheless, 
for 35 percent of area cultivated, supplemental irrigation is used in the dry season. Groundnut 
cultivation is concentrated in the Northeast 
and North zones which account for 70 percent of 
groundnut area cultivated, (45.7 and 24.5
 percent, respectively).     
2.14 The share of gross cultivated area devot
ed to horticultural and other crops has 
increased from 15.1 percent in 1980-81 to 19.5 p
ercent in 1990-91, but has remained at only 
19.1 percent in 2001-02
.  In 2002-03 approximately 815,000 hectares (12.5 percent of total 
cropped area) was under horticultural crops. Plantation crops accounted for 29 percent of the 

horticultural crop area with fruits, vegetables and spices accounting for a further 28 percent, 22 
percent and 19 percent, respectively. The re
cently announced Comprehensive Wasteland 
Programme aims at promoting perennial horticulture crops on 2 million hectares of cultivable 
wastelands in the state. The 
state has also been promoting the cultivation of medicinal and 
aromatic plants with these crops accounting for 
approximately 5000 hectares (less than 1 percent 
of total cropped area). There is a growing interest in bio-fuel crops (Jatropha and Paradise Tree) 
although these crops are yet to be grown commercially in the state.

 Output Price Incentives: Nominal Rat
es of Protection for Major Commodities 
 2.15 For most of the last two decades, produ
cers of rice and cotton in Tamil Nadu have 
been implicitly taxed through price and trad
e policies that kept domestic prices below 
 14border prices
.12 The nominal protection coefficient (NPC) for paddy, calculated as the domestic 
price (in this case the procurement price for common variety paddy), divided by the border price,  
averaged only 0.64 in the 1990s; i.e. the procur
ement price was on average 36 percent below the 
border price (Table  2.8).  Similarly, cotton (kapas) prices  were 26 percent below border prices 
(average across India).  Sugar prices, however, 
were 21 percent higher th
an border prices in the 
1980s and only 8 percent below border prices in the 1990s.  2.16 There has been no implicit taxation of rice in Tamil Nadu through price and trade 
policies in recent years, however
.  NPC™s for paddy in 2001-02 are, in fact, slightly positive.  
Cotton (all-India average) remains taxed relativ
e to international prices, as does groundnut.
13  Prices of refined sugar are likewise near (import parity) border prices.  Thus, estimated trade 
distortions for the two most water-intensive ma
jor crops in Tamil Nadu (paddy and sugar cane) 
have declined, and were mi
nimal in 2001 and 2002.

Agricultural Inputs: Fertilizer Use and Mechanization 
 Average fertilizer consumption in Tamil Nadu has increased
 over the years with consumption 
per hectare increasing from 107.86 Kg in 1986/87 to
 121.03 Kg in 1999/00, an average annual 
growth rate of 1.90 percent per annum. Aver
age per hectare consumption was  66.7 Kg for 
Nitrogen, 28.33 Kg for Potash and 26.01 Kg 
for phosphorous. Approximately 67 percent of 
households growing crops report use of fertilizers (
Table  2.9).  The proportion of farmers 
reporting use of fertilizers is slightly lower than Punjab and AP, but higher states such as 

Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

                                                      
 12    Note that the nominal protection coefficients 
do not include any adjustment in exchange rates.  
Accounting for the overvaluation of the rupee in the 1980s and early 1990s would raise the estimated 
border price in rupee terms and lowe
r the nominal protection co
efficients in this period.  Thus, the degree 
of taxation on Tamil Nadu agriculture in the 1980s 
and early 1990s is understated in Table  2.8.   
13   The estimated 21 percent implicit taxation of groundnuts relative to world prices may reflect domestic 
constraints in processing and marketing, as well as 
differences in quality of groundnuts for alternative end 
uses (direct consumption and crus
hing for groundnut cake and oil).

 2.17 Rates of pesticide consumption appear to be declining over time
 with growing 
awareness of the deleterious health effects of expos
ure to chemicals, the use of organic pesticides 
and the adoption of pest resistant varieties of crops
.  Despite this farmers 
in Tamil Nadu appear to 
be more likely to use pesticid
es and weedicides as compared to farmers in Neighboring states 
such as AP, Karantaka and Maharashtra.  Approximately 53 percent of farmers in Tamil Nadu 
report using weedicides and about 86 percent repor
t using pesticide, insecticides, fungicides etc.  
The proportion of households reporting using pestic
ides is comparable to Punjab.  Approximately 
67 percent of farmers report using improved varieties of seeds. The proportion of farmers using 

improved varieties of seeds in Tamil Nadu is less than most southern Indian states and Punjab 

where close to 80 percent of farmers use improved seed varieties.  
2.18 The degree of mechanization in agriculture 
in Tamil Nadu is still relatively low
 although it is higher than most southern states. According to data from the 54
th round of the NSS 
(1998), only 50 percent of  agricultural households
 in the state used tractors or power tillers 
(Table  2.9).  While the degree of mechanization is re
latively low compared to Punjab where more 
than 90 percent of agricultural households reported using tractors/power tillers it is higher than most southern state including Andhra Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Karnataka. The majority of 
households  (89 percent)  using tractors or power tillers in Tamil Nadu  rented these services.  
Land  2.1 Current land distribution and use in much
 of Tamil Nadu reflect centuries old 
patterns of settlement and cultivation in the valleys and plains
.14  In pre-colonial society, 
                                                     
 14 Baker (1984) distinguishes a third major region, Kongunad, in western Tamil Nadu (approximating the 
modern districts of Coimbatore and Erode), as a mix of plains and valley geography and society.  P.93f 
 16river valley villages, where agriculture centered on 
irrigated rice, were divided into two exclusive 
groups: the land owning Brahman and Vellala (nobl
es), and the outcaste laborers (usually Pallan 
or Paraiyan) (Baker, 1984:87).  The economy of the 
drier plains with generally poor soils outside 
the valleys was based on livestock, hunting, culti
vation of millet, and non-agricultural activities.
15   2.2 The average farm size (individual holdings) 
in 1995-96 was only 0.91 hectares, with 
52.5 percent of farms less than 0.5 hectares
 (Table  2.10). 74.3 percent of farms were less than 
1.0 hectare, accounting for only 30.2 percent of the land.

Land Resource Policy and Administration   
 2.19 There is no explicit statement of State Land Use policy in Tamil Nadu; the policies 
are implicit in the legislative and administra
tive measures related to the regulation of land 
use.  The Revenue Department administrates all 
the government lands including those vested 
with the various departments of the state gove
rnment.  Following the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass 
Book Act, 1983, private owners of agricultural land 
are issued Patta pass books.  These serve as 
evidence of ownership that facilitates loans fro
m financial institutions, co-operative banks and 
commercial bank. 
2.20 Land reforms in India were designed to (1) to
 enhance the productivity of land (2) to 
ensure distributive justice (3) to create a syst
em of peasant proprietorship and (4) to transfer the incomes of the few to many so
 that the demand for consumer goods would be 
created.  By 1972, laws had been passed in all the 
States to abolish intermediaries. In Tamil 
Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Or
issa, measures in the form of an order for 
staying ejection have been adopted to give tem
porary protection to the tenants. As a result of 
these measures, 92 per cent of the holdings in Indi
a are wholly owned and self-operated.  By the 
year 1972, ceiling legislation had been passed in 
all the States. Land ceilings in Tamil Nadu (4.86 
hectares for irrigated land with two crops; 12.14
 hectares for irrigated land with one crop and 
24.28 hectares for dry land) have relatively little 
effect on land distribution, however, due to 
registration of land in the names of various family
 members, and reportedly even in the names of 
                                                     
 15 ﬁThe importance of agriculture in the valleys made
 control of land the crucial feature of social 
organiztion.  By contrast the crucial feature in the 
plains was control of men– The importance of military 
service and, to a lesser extent, the production of goods and services, laid great stress on the control of men 
and their ability to work or fight.ﬂ Baker, p. 90. 
 17workers (with their knowledge).  Nonetheless, th
e number of farms greater than 10 hectares is 
rather small (0.33 percent), accounti
ng for only 8.41 percent of area (
Table  2.10). 
Livestock  2.21 The performance of the livestock sector has been strong. 
The livestock sector 
(including animal husbandry, poultry and dairy) is
 an important contributor to Tamil Nadu™s 
agricultural growth.  This sectors is also important for rural livelihoods offering a source of 
income and employment. For many rural househ
olds livestock are the main instrument for 
savings and insurance. Livestock also provide a source of power for tilling land and organic 
fertilizer (manure). According to the last census,
 TN had about 5.3 percent of India™s livestock 
population. Thirty-eight percent of the livestock population comprises of cattle, 11 percent of 
buffaloes, 25 percent goat, 20 percent sheep a
nd 2 percent pigs  (Livestock Census, 1997).
16  TN 
ranks second among Indian states in egg producti
on and nineth in terms of milk production.
17  Approximately 6 percent of national milk prod
uction came from TN in 2001/02 and the state 
accounted for 11.9 percent of  India™s egg production. 
2.22 There is significant growth potential for the livestock and poultry sectors arising 
from growing consumer demand.
  With increasing urbanization and growing per capita 
incomes, the demand for animal products (meat, 
eggs and dairy) in Tamil Nadu have been 
increasing. Production of the main animal products
 has also been increasing to meet consumer 
demand.  Milk production in the state has increased from 3.29 million tones in 1986-87 to 4.90 
million tones in 2000-2001. Milk production increased at an average annual rate of 4 percent. Egg 

production has also increased by approximately 
4 percent per annum in the 1990s. Growth of  
meat production has been much slower averagi
ng 1 percent per annum between 1996/97-99/00. 
Cross bread cows contribute to approximately 37 per
cent of the milk produced in the state, while 
indigenous breads and  buffaloes contribute roughly 
26 percent and 37 percent, respectively. Milk 
yields (yield per animal) from crossbred cows of 
5.72 Kg/day are slightly lower than the all-India 
average of 6.36 Kg/day, but significantly lower than
 yields in Punjab (8
.7 Kg/day).  The same 
trend can be observed for yields from buffalo
es which is 3.68 Kg/day. Yield from indigenous 
cows (2.4 Kg/day) are comp
aratively high compared to most India states.   
2.23 Most of the poultry production in the state derives from large commercial units
. 70 percent of  poultry products are produced by 
commercial farmers with 
the remaining 30 percent 
being produced by small holders (personal comm
unication with Secretary, Animal Husbandry). 
While this increases efficiency 
in production, food safety concerns and concerns for animal 
welfare will increase. Environmental effects, pa
rticularly eutrophication from high levels of 
phosphorous and nitrogen runoffs, could become pr
oblematic without proper regulation. Small-
holders may be crowded out of the sector since by its structure the industry lends itself to 
economies of scale. The growth in the poultry i
ndustry has contributed to rapidly increasing 
demand for maize as poultry feed. 
2.24 Unlike poultry production, the dairy industry is still dominated by small-holders.
 Much of the milk produced in the state is ma
rketed through milk producers cooperatives. In 2001-
2002 the state had 8,238 Dairy Cooperative Societies with a membership of approximately 2.04 
million members. The number of dairy coopera
tives and farmer members in Tamil Nadu has 
almost quadrupled since the early 1980s (NDDB, Annual Report, 2000/01). The commercial 

sector produces 30 percent of milk, with small 
holders (who have an average of 1-3 cows)

ersonal communication with Secretary, Animal

duced fodder production which has implications 
for the quality of milk yields from cows and 
buffaloes. Adequate cold storage and further 
improvements in veterinary services are needed 
for this sector to realize its full potential. 
Fisheries 
 2.25 Tamil Nadu™s fisheries sector has significan
t potential, but its performance has been 
mixed.  
The state has a coastal length of 1,076 km, equi
valent to 15% of India™s coast line and is 
also well-endowed in terms of in-land fisheries.  The inland fisheries sector has about 370,000 ha 
of water spread area, comprising of 52,000 ha of reservoirs, 97,700 ha of major irrigation and 
long seasonal tanks, 158,100 ha of
 short seasonal tanks and ponds 
and 63,000 ha under estuaries, backwaters and swamps.

 2.26 The contribution of the fisheries sector to
 total agricultural and allied sector GDP 
has decreased over the past two decades from 
roughly 7% in the early 1980s to 4.5% in 
2001/02 
(Figure  2.4:). Growth in the fisheries sub sector 
has fluctuated and growth rates 
consistently fall below all-India averages.  Pr
oduction is around 0.5 million tones with four-fifths 
of fish production from wild fisheries (marine fi
sheries). The state™s fish
 production accounts for 13.2 percent of total marine fish production and 4 
percent of total in-land fish production in India 
(GoTN, 2001c).  
2.27 Marine fisheries are an important export
 earner for the state and accounted for 
5.5% of total export earnings in 2001
. The coast of Tamil Nadu has also become attractive for 
investment in shrimp culture. However growth 
in shrimp production has slowed down since a ban 
was imposed on shrimp culture in the Coastal Regul
ation Zone (area within 50 metres of the coast 
line) due to growing problems with salinity  (GoTN, 2001c).   
 The Rural Non-farm Sector 
 2.28 The non-farm sector is an important so
urce of income and employment for rural 
households in Tamil Nadu
.  Data from 1993/94 indicate that on average income from non-farm 
sources accounted for 46.4 percent of rural house
holds incomes. The average real per capita

Other sources
income in 1993/94 was Rs 4,867. In Tamil 
Nadu the share of non-farm income increases 
monotonically with households wealth. For the 
lowest expenditure quintile, non-farm incomes accounted for 19.8 percent of household incomes, on 
average.  In contrast, income from non-farm 
sources contributed slightly more than half of household income for 
the  wealthiest quintile.                       
  2.29 The Government of Tamil Nadu has enco
uraged development of the non-farm sector through the Tamil Nadu Khadi and V
illage Industries Board established in 1960.  The Board promotes Khadi and Village Industries 
in order to create employment opportunities for 
rural artisans. Khadi industries are involved in the  production of cotton, wool, silk and muslin 
while village industries engage in production ac
tivities that are mineral-, forest-, polymer and 
chemical-, agro-, engineering-, textile-, and service-based. 
The Board provides financial assistance 
to artisans to start their own industries.
 In 2000-01 Khadi and Village Industries provided employment for approximately 1 million worker
s. Among the various industries, almost 71 
percent of employment was in agro-based indus
tries with Palm Gur production alone accounting 
for 60 percent of employment in Khadi and Village industries  (
Figure  2.6:).  Total earnings of 
the Khadi and Village based industries in 2000/01 amounted to approximately Rs 2.7 billion.  
Other important industries in term
s of employment creation were 
pottery, bee-keeping and village 
leather production.

 2.30 Continued growth of the agro-processing sector is likely
. Value added in the agro-
processing sector in Tamil Nadu grew by 
3.4 percent between 1989/90 and 1997/98, the 
latest year for which data is available
  (Table  2.12).
 Population growth, rising incomes, and 
increased urbanization will foster an increasing 
shift in demand from raw, unprocessed products 
to high value processed foods. Food products and 
cotton textiles accounted for 10 percent  and 28 
percent of net value added by the industrial sector
 in the late 1990s (1997/87). By 1997/98 four 
agro-processing industries, cotton spinning, w
eaving and processing, processing, manufacture 
and refining of sugar, processing 
and blending of tea and grain milling accounted for 87 percent 
of value added in the agro-processing sector and clos
e to 80 percent of employment in the sector 
(Figure  2.7:). 
2.31  In order to encourage growth of the agro-processing sector Tamil Nadu has 
recently launched the New Anna Marumalarchi Thittam
. The 2002-03 Budget speech 
announced the restructuring of the existing A
nna Marumalarchi Thittam scheme into the New 
Source:   Lanjouw, Jayaraman and Kijima, 2003
 20Anna Marumalarchi Thittam which will place 
special emphasis on the agro-processing sector. 
The new scheme in effect since June 2002 encour
ages the development of 
small scale agro-based 
industries such as processing of horticultural prod
ucts, flower based extracts, coir and food 
processing. Under the scheme, investment in agro-based industries w
ill be encouraged in each of 
the 385 Blocks of Tamil Nadu through a packages of subsidies and incentives.

 223. Water for Agriculture 
 3.1 Tamil Nadu is a water scarce state. The annual 
per capita availability of water resources 
of Tamil Nadu is only 900 cubic meters compared 
to an all-India average of 2200 cubic meters. 
The rainfall received by the state is highly variable
 and drought conditions prevail in three out of 
every 10 years.  Water is an essential factor 
of production for agriculture, which consumes 75% 
of the state™s water resources.  Faced with growing scarcity, increasing demand for water from 

industries and commercial uses, and intensifying  
interstate competition for water, improving the 
productivity of water (ﬁgetting more crop from every 
dropﬂ) in irrigated and rainfed agriculture is 
of great urgency in Tamil Nadu.  
3.2 Improving the productivity of water in agriculture needs commitments to policy, 
institutional and management reforms as well as investments in crop research, technology and 
infrastructure. Tamil Nadu has already embarked 
on a process of reform including decentralizing 
water resources management along river basins, fo
rmalizing irrigation management transfer to 
users, revising water tariffs, and promoting wa
ter saving technologies.  Commencing with a brief 
introduction to water resources in the state, th
e following chapter elaborates on recent reforms 
and the challenges that lie ahead for the state to
 increase agricultural growth while meeting the 
needs of other uses.  
Water Resources  
 3.3 Geographically, most of Tamil Nadu is a dr
y plain, with river valleys surrounded by 
low hills.  The normal rainfall in the plains in the state is 925 millimeters per year, concentrated 
during two monsoon seasons-the southwest a
nd the northeast monsoon (Agrostat, 2001).
18 Most 
of the rains from the southwest monsoon extending
 from June through September are blocked by 
mountains (the Western Ghats), on Tamil Nadu™s 
western border with Kerala and Karnataka.  
Except in the southern tip of Tamil Nadu (especi
ally Kanniyakumari district), the southwestern 
monsoons are highly variable. The northeast mons
oon rains, from October through December are 
more reliable and on average account for 47 percent of
 annual rainfall in the state. Little rain falls during the winter (January-Februar
y) or summer (March-May).   
                                                                                 Figure 
 3.1:  Rainfall and Agricultural & Allied GSDP 
 3.4 Rainfall in the state is highly variable and 
has a pronounced effect on the performance of 
the agricultural sector
 (Figure  3.1, Table  3.1). In 
six years between 1980 and 2001 total rainfall was 
less than 90 percent of the average for the two 

decades.  For these years, 
 real agricultural GDP was on average 8.1 percent below trend GDP. A 
regression analysis shows that a one percent 
increase in rainfall relative to the mean is

3.5 Tamil Nadu has 17 river basins
 (including groups of minor basins), all flowing eastwards 
from the Western Ghats and Deccan plateau.
20  The major rivers in the state are the Cauvery, 
Palar, Vellar, Vaigai and Tambaraparani. The Cauv
ery delta, the largest river basin in the state, 
has been the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu for over 1500 years since the construction of the Grand 
Anicut (dam), which diverted water from the Ca
uvery to a system of irrigation canals. Water 
from the Cauvery is used to irrigate approxima
tely 20 million hectares of land in Tamil Nadu. 
Cauvery water is shared with Ka
rnataka (located upstream) and is the subject of ongoing disputes 
between the two states.   3.6 The state™s water resources are divided near
ly evenly between surface water (23.6 
billion cubic meters) and groundwater (22.3 billion cubic meters)
.  Utilization rates are 
estimated to be 93% for surface water and 60% for groundwater. In many parts of the state, the 
rate of extraction of groundwater has exceeded recharge rates contributing to falling water tables.  
Out of 385 blocks in the state 23 percent are 
dark (extraction exceeding 100 percent of the recharge), another 23 percent of blocks are grey (extraction exceeding 65 percent of the 
recharge). The dark and grey blocks are particularly concentrated in the Western and North-
Western Zones.  3.7 Water quality issues are of increasing importance
. Effluents discharged from industries 
involved in dying and bleaching, as well as increasi
ng use of fertilizers and pesticides, have had a 
major impact on surface water quality, soils and grou
ndwater.  For example, in the Noyyal river, 
a tributary of the Cauvery river, uncontrolled disch
arge of total dissolved solids have adversely affected agriculture as pollutants have contaminated water sources and soils.   
Overview of  Water Use in Agriculture 
 3.8 Most farmers own only irrigated land or
 non-irrigated land; few farmers own 
significant amounts of both irrigated and non-irrigated land
.  According to data from the 55
th round of the Indian National Sample Survey (N
SS), in 1999/00 approximately 25 percent of 
farms in Tamil Nadu used little or no irrigation; 
by contrast, 65 percent of farms consisted of 
almost entirely irrigated land.  Only about 10 percent of farms had significant shares (at least 20 
percent) of both irrigated and non-irrigated la
nd.  Thus, agricultural programs that focus on 
irrigated crops will generally not directly bene
fit 25 percent of farm households.  Similarly, 
                                                     
 20 Some of these basins, including the Cauvery,
 are partially located in neighboring states. 
 24programs that focus on non-irrigated crops will gene
rally not directly benefit the 65 percent of 
farm households with essentia
lly no non-irrigated land (

  Rainfed Agriculture 
 3.9 Rainfed agriculture accounts for 45 percent of the gross cultivated area of 6.5 million 
hectares in Tamil Nadu and approximately 25 percent of farmers in the state are engaged in 
rainfed agriculture. Despite its importance as a source of income and employment, productivity 
in rainfed agriculture has been low. Tamil 
Nadu has implemented a number of centrally 
sponsored and donor funded watershed devel
opment schemes aimed at improving the production 
potential of rainfed agriculture. These schemes 
include the Drought Prone Areas Programme 
(DPAP), the National Watershed Developmen
t Project for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA), the 
Integrated Wasteland Development Pr
ogramme (IWDP) and the DANIDA funded Comprehensive Watershed Development Projects.  
3.10 The DPAP implemented in Tamil Nadu since 
the early 1970s promotes natural resource 
management in watersheds so as to mitigate th
e adverse effects of drought, prevent further 
degradation and generate empl
oyment through non-farm activities. IWDP has the broad 
 25objectives of sustainability, equity and environm
ental conservation to meet timber, fodder and 
fuel needs and to increase employment opportun
ities for Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes and 
other socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This
 program has been implemented in the state 
since 1993/94 in non-DPAP blocks. NWDPRA focu
ses on sustainable production of biomass and 
restoration of ecological balance in watershe
ds and has been operational since 1990-91. This 
initiative has recently been restru
ctured into the Watershed Areas Rainfed Agricultural Systems 
Approach  (WARASA). All of these programs are jointly funded by the Central government and 
GoTN, with the center responsible for at least 75 percent of the costs. 
3.11 The recently launched Comprehensive Wasteland Programme is a major initiative 
promoted by the GoTN which holds potential 
for improving water productivity in rainfed 
lands.  The program aims to reclaim current fallow wastelands through a micro watershed 
development program focusing on 
soil and water conservation. 
Roughly 17 percent of Tamil 
Nadu™s land area is classified as wastelands.
21 The program has two main components.  The first 
promotes participatory watershed 
development of  patta lands.
22  The second component seeks to 
encourage development of government owned wast
elands by corporate houses, small companies, 
cooperatives and Federations of Women™s Self Help Groups.  
3.12 Farmers participating in the participatory wa
tershed approach will receive a subsidy to 
partially cover costs for planting and irrigating 
horticultural and agro-forestry crops such as 
mangoes, cashew, sapota, tamarind, neem, silk 
cotton in the watersheds. The involvement of 
corporations in wasteland development will be
 encouraged by offering 30 year leases for 
wastelands of up to 1,000 acres to corporations that
 are interested in raising horticultural crops or 
bio-mass plantations on wastelands. Corpora
tions leasing land under this program will pay 
concessional amounts of rent proportional to land value for use of the land.   
3.13 Although watershed projects have been widely promoted throughout India the 
success of these projects in terms of curbing 
land degradation, improvi
ng the productivity of rainfed agriculture and reducing rural poverty has been limited
.  Reviews of watershed 
development programs in India have found that
 successful approaches to watershed development 
have entailed extensive community participation with sound technical inputs. The evidence also 
reveals that benefits of these projects have b
een skewed towards landowners, with landless people 
benefiting indirectly.  In some cases women and 
landless may have actually been made worse off 
as their access to common property resources may be restricted as a result of  project 
interventions. Adequately addressing these equity 
issues remains a challenge for governments and 
NGOs involved with implementing watershed projects.
 It has also been found that subsidies for 
soil and water conservation, and the opportuniti
es for employment, can induce farmers to accept 
soil conservation strategies that they do not really want and are hence difficult to sustain in the 

long run once the project ends (Kerr et al, 2002). 
 Tailoring conservation strategies to practices 
that farmers really want will be important in 
ensuring the success and long run sustainability of 
future initiatives.  For programs such as the Comprehensive Wasteland Programme, it is also 
important that the state adopts a basin perspective in implementation to ensure that these 
initiatives do not have negative impact
s on downstream human and ecological uses
.    3.14 Rainwater harvesting is being promoted on a large scale in the state in an effort to 
supplement ground water resources
. As much of the rainfall is received in a very short period, 
                                                     
 21 Wastelands include barren and uncultivable land, cultivable waste, permanent pastures and other grazing 
lands, other fallow lands, 50 per cent of current fallows and 40 per cent of dry land. 
 22 Private lands where owners are issued a Patta Pass Book 
 26rain water harvesting offers the ability to capture
 a transitory resource and can provide sufficient 
water to grow less water-intensive crops.
23 In urban areas, rainwater harvesting is a potential 
source of water for consumption purposes.  As of
 July, 2003, the Government of Tamil Nadu has 
passed an ordinance requiring all buildings in the state to install rainwater harvesting structures 
before the monsoon.   
 Irrigated Agriculture 
 3.15 Tamil Nadu has a net irrigated area of 3 million hectares (1999/00).  Most irrigated lands 
are only irrigated for a single season and the state™
s irrigation intensity of 121 percent is relatively 
low.24  Today the state is equally reliant on 
surface and groundwater sources for irrigation, although its reliance on groundwater sources has been steadily increasing (
Figure  3.3).  
Approximately 30 percent of the net irrigated ar
ea is irrigated by water from canals.  An 
additional 21 percent is irrigated by tanks, while 
wells are used to irrigate 49 percent of the net 
irrigated area. The remaining area is irrigated by other sources such as streams and springs. Net 

irrigated area has increased by about 10 percen
t in the past two decades from 2.7 million ha in 
1981/82, due mainly to a 39 percent increase in area
 irrigated by wells.  Over the same period, 
area irrigated by canals and tanks decreased 
by approximately 4 percent and 14 percent, 
respectively.

Surface irrigation 
 3.16 Tamil Nadu has constructed more than 85 la
rge and medium dams since independence.  
As the surface irrigation potential has virtually been exhausted, mode
rnizing and rehabilitating 
existing systems is crucial to improve the efficiency of surface irrigation. The majority of canal 
systems in the state are old and have very poor 
efficiency as a result of seepage and silting in the 
canals (GoTN, 2001a).  In recent years the state 
has undertaken some major canal modernization 
projects with the aide of World Bank funding unde
r the Water Resources Consolidation Project.   
                                                      
 23 On average there are 30 rainy days during the southwest monsoon and 55 rainy days during the northeast 
monsoon.   
24 The all-India irrigation intensity is 132%.   
 273.17 In the 1960s, tank irrigation accounted for almost 37 percent of net irrigated area in 
Tamil Nadu. Area irrigated with tanks has steadily 
declined over time, however, because of 
siltation in tank beds and supply 
channels, encroachments in the 
tank bund, foreshore, and supply 
channels, and damaged sluices, weirs and bunds,. There are currently 41,948 tanks in the state of 
TN irrigating an area of 0.63 million hectares, the average area irrigated by a tank is 15.1 ha.  Due 
to water shortages a large number of tanks in the 
state are defunct.  A recent study found that in a 
10 year period, tanks are only full for 2 years, they are partially full for 5 years and fail for 3 out 

of 10 years. Water markets are becoming increasingly important in the tank command areas and 

provide a means to supplement inadequate tank i
rrigation water particularly at the end of the 
paddy season. Farmers normally spend about 20 percent of their rice crop income on buying 

water from well owners.  Since 
only 15 percent of farmers own wells in the tank command, 
demand for supplemental irrigation is high (Palanisami, 2003).   
Groundwater Irrigation  3.18 Factors including rural electrification, the availability of affordable irrigation pump sets 
and cheap or free electricity for agriculture 
have contributed to the increasing reliance on 
groundwater for irrigation in Tamil Nadu.  
Both the number of wells and area irrigated by them 
registered significant increases 
over the years. The number of wells (dug and tube wells) had 
increased from 1.68 million during 1981-82 to 1.83 million in 1999-2000, the area irrigated by them 
rose from 1.05 million ha. to 1.45 million ha. 
 3.19 Overexploitation of groundwater resources 
is a major problem facing the state. Of a total of 1.8 million wells in the state, approxima
tely 10 percent are now defunct. The depth of 
bore wells in hard rock area has increased to 
as much as 600ft to 1000ft.  Today, use of dug wells 
as a source of irrigation is only possible in canal
 and tank command areas; only bore wells remain 
operational in hard rock areas (mainly in the western part of the state).
25  Due to acute water scarcity the Government of Tamil Nadu has recen
tly announced its plans 
to ban the drilling of bore wells, particularly in hard rock areas. This
 however has had a perverse effect as farmers are 
rushing to drill additional wells before the ban 
is officially imposed. Spacing norms have been 
prescribed based on the guidelines issued by 
NABARD (National Bank for Agricultural and 
Rural Development). Dug wells must be at least 150 
m apart; deep tube wells must be at least 600 
m apart. These spacing norms for the construction 
of new structures for minor irrigation purposes 
are applicable throughout the state for wells that
 are constructed with the aide of institutional 
finance. Institutions  3.20 Institutional weaknesses undermined proper management and development of 
water resources in Tamil Nadu
. Institutional arrangements did 
not adequately address water 
resources management, allocation and planning.  
There has also been a lack of expenditure 
prioritization; inadequate priority to and fundi
ng for operations and ma
intenance (O&M) has led to rapid deterioration of surface irrigation. Farm
er involvement in the operation and maintenance 
of irrigation systems has been minimal. Recently, 
however, effort has been made to address many 
of the policy and institutional issues plaguing the water sector.  
3.21 The state is now undertaking 
comprehensive water planning on a river basin basis
 and 
has decentralized water resource management along 
river basins.  The Public Works Department 
has been divided into the 
Water Resources Organization (WRO) 
and the Buildings 
                                                     
 25 Personal communication with K. Palanisami (TNAU). 
 28Organization in 1995.
 The WRO is to be formalized as a separate agency with a specialized cadre 
of staff in 2004.
 Chief Engineers of the WRO have been reorganized along a river basin basis and 
Government Orders setting up the Palar Basin 
Development and Management Board and the 
Thambaraparani Basin Developm
ent and Management Board were issued in January, 2000. 
Preparation of macro-level basin development plans and formulation of decision support systems 
for development and management of the water 
resources of the state has been underway since 
1997.  
3.22 The state has also drafted a Water Policy and steps for irrigation management 
transfer have also been initiated
. The Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems 
Bill was passed  by the State Legislative Assembly 
in May, 2000. The state was one of the first in 
India to pass a Groundwater Regulation and Management Act. Development of requisite skills in 
environmental aspects of water resources for staf
f in specified units of the Public Works 
Department has been a s
ubstantial achievement.  
Irrigation Management Transfer  3.23 Traditionally rural communities have played a 
central role in the management of water 
resources in Tamil Nadu. Informal arrangements 
under the system of ﬁkudimaramathu™ were 
widespread for the maintenance and management 
 of irrigation tanks up until the middle of the 
19th century. Various other spontaneously created fa
rmer organizations also played an important 
part in the management of canal systems, as well.    
3.24 Between 1988 and 1994 as part of the 
Command Area Development Programme, the 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural Engineering Department 
organized Water User Associations in five 
major systems. By 1994, 3,300 outlet level WU
As and 118 distributory canal level WUAs had 
been formed, though most were not functioning well (Brewer et al., 1999).  The motivation for 
formally transferring irrigation management to 
canal irrigation users in the state was largely 
driven by the pressure of maintaining canal syst
ems in a situation of fiscal stress, increasing  
inter-sectoral competition for water resources, 
and advice from the World Bank as part of the 
WRCP project.  3.25 To enable management transfer to farmers, the Tamil Nadu Farmers Management 
of Irrigation  Systems Bill was passed  by the State Legislative Assembly  in May, 2000
.   
This Act will be in force in an area coveri
ng 1.5 million hectares in the system command areas 
under the management and control of WRO.   
3.26 The Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems' (FMIS) Bill created a three-
tier system management organization, including WUAs at the outlet, WUAs at the 500 hectare 
command levels and a joint management committe
e(JMC) (a committee including representatives 
of the WUAs and of key government agencies) at the project level.
26  The Bill also allows for the 
full or partial transfer of O&M responsib
ilities to these bodies.  Each WUA has complete 
responsibility for water distributio
n and maintenance in the area 
under its jurisdiction. The JMC 
is afforded the responsibility of deciding on wa
ter allocations and distribution each season and for 
solving problems as they arise.    
3.27 Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and evaluations 
of its impact  in Tamil Nadu are yet to be carri
ed out.  However, there is a growing body of 
evidence on the impact of IMT from other states in 
India which is likely to be relevant for Tamil 
                                                     
 26 The JMC™s are known as Farmer Councils 
 29A recent study undertaken by the International 
Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the 
Gujarat Institute of Development Research (GIDR)
 sheds some important insights into pro-poor 
IMT in large-scale canal irrigation systems.  The 
study is based on a survey of 700 landowning and 
tenant farmers from seven WUA™s in the two states. The study found that IMT in AP and Gujarat 
led to improved access to water for 15% and 25
% of farmers surveyed and extension of the 
irrigated area for 2% and 3% of farmers in the tw
o states, respectively. Ho
wever, the authors also 
find that poor farmers are less 
informed about their rights and tend to loose out on many of the 
potential benefits of IMT.   
 The report makes the following recommendations in terms of making IMT more pro-poor.   
 1. The rights of farmers need to
 be clearly defined.  Individual farmers within the WUA 
should have equal decision making power regardless of farm size. 
2. The awareness of poor farmers and access to 
information on the IMT process should be 
raised.  Differences in access to information 
between poor and wealthy farmers contribute 
to inequities. Wealthy farmers tend to be better informed of their rights and 

responsibilities as WUA members and participate more in the decision-making processes.  

Small farmers were more likely to be unaware 
of the existence of WUAs.  The absence of 
small farmers from committee and general mee
tings means that they are excluded from 
key decisions taken within the WUA including decisions on the use of funds, site 

selection for R&R (Resettlement and Rehabilitation), future self-management of water 
distribution etc.  
3. The election process within the WUA should be
 competitive and transparent.  Election of 
new presidents and committee 
members should be vote-based rather than consensus-
based, to promote competition between several candidates. 
4. The levels of participation (in WUA elections, decision-making processes, fee collection 

etc) by farm size and location should be monitored.. Farm size has proven to be a good 
indicator of relative wealth and monitoring 
participation by farm size provides a good 
indicator of equity trends.

Nadu as WUAs and JMCs begin to play a larger 
role in the management of irrigation systems 
(Text Box  3.1).  
 Text Box 
 3.1:  Pro-poor Irriga
tion Management Transfer 
Water and Electricity Charges 
 3.28 Tamil Nadu has an extremely complicated system of water charges for surface 
irrigation compared to most Indian states
.  Currently there are 188 water rates  (133 for wet 
lands and 55 for dry lands) for farmers depe
nding on soil type, irrigation source, crop grown, 
season etc. Currently water rates  form part of 
the land revenue collected from farmers by village 
administrative officers.  Apart from the basic wa
ter rate there is a local cess and a local cess 
surcharge levied as a multiple of the basic water ra
te paid by farmers.  The revenue from the local 
cess and local cess surcharge is transferred to Panchayat bodies for general expenditures.  
3.29 At present the revenue department is involve
d in both assessments of water charges and 
collection.  The VAOs (village officials) are supposed to inspect the field and record the cropped area, the area under government sources of irrigati
on (e.g. canals, tanks, etc.) and crop conditions. 
A sample check is conducted by higher officials such as the Revenue Inspector/Deputy Tasildars.  
 30At the end of the agricultural year (fasli year),
 the accounts are prepared and water charges are 
collected along with the land revenue.  The my
riad of water rates provide considerable 
discretionary power to assessors.   
 3.30 Until recent revisions, water rates had been untouched since 1962
. Beginning in July 
2003, however, an additional water charge of Rs
 150/ha ,de-linked from any additional cess, was 
imposed.  Thus the farmer will pay the original ch
arge plus the Rs 150/ha.  In addition, the FMIS 
Act empowers the water users™ associations to ch
arge users between Rs 250/ha to Rs 500/ha.  
This additional charge can be retained by the 
WUA for operation and maintenance of the systems 
turned over to them. 

 
3.31 In 1999/00 total O&M expenditures on irriga
tion amounted to Rs 45.6 Crores.  Total 
revenue collected was roughly Rs 11 Crores. Henc
e cost recovery was less than 25 percent (

 3.32 Low water charges and poor cost recovery
 has meant that canal irrigation users 
have received an implicit subsidy
. In 2000/01 the implicit irrigation subsidy (defined as the 
difference between O&M expenditures and actual co
llection of water charges) amounted to Rs 
333.5 million. Based on an estimated gross canal 
irrigated area of 0.87 million hectares this 
translates into a per hectare subsidy of  Rs 649.
27 3.33 The vast majority of rural households in Tamil Nadu do not benefit directly from 
canal irrigation subsidies; in fact only 7 percent of rural households (15 percent of 
households cultivating crops) enjoy these implicit subsidies
.  However, the distribution of 
canal irrigation subsidies among households that use canal irrigation is less regressive than in 

other major Indian states (World Bank, 2003a). 
In Tamil Nadu over 90 percent of farmers using 
canal irrigation are marginal and small farmers and these farmers capture approximately 76 
                                                     
 27 Exact data on gross canal irrigated area are not available.  Gross canal irrigated area is computed as the 
net canal irrigated area multiplied by the intensity of irrigation  (1.2062). 
 31percent of the canal irrigation subsidy. The aver
age subsidy received by households using canal 
irrigation in 2000/01 was Rs 493.67.  Owing to larg
er farm sizes, large farmers enjoy average 
subsidies that are more than four times as large 
as those enjoyed by marginal and small farmers  
(Table  3.4).

Agricultural Power Tariffs 
 3.34 Until recently farmers pumping groundwater 
for irrigation with the use of electric 
pump sets have benefited 
from free electricity.  Free electricity for agricultural consumers 
coupled with irrigators not internalizing the envi
ronmental costs of their 
water use, has reduced 
incentives for conservation (encouraging over ex
traction of groundwater) and encouraged the 
cultivation of water-intensive crops. Provision of 
free electricity for agricultural power consumers 
has also contributed to the deteriorating finances of the state™s power sector affecting the 
economy™s growth and fiscal health.   
3.35 In Tamil Nadu, as in the rest of India, the electricity tariff charged from industrial and commercial consumers cross-subsidizes 
domestic and agricultural consumers
.  This policy has contributed to rapid expansion in consumption from subsidized categories and 
stagnation in consumption from subsidizing cat
egories (World Bank, 2003).  Industries, 
commercial users and even many domestic consumers 
have had to make large investments in self 
generation capability which is highly inefficient.
  This, along with the cross subsidy, has an 
impact on the competitiveness of the state™s industries and economy.  Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Board™s financial distress has contained its ab
ility to make investments, resulting in uneven 
quality of supply and generation shortages.  
3.36 Apart from these environmental and fiscal issues, the distribution of power 
subsidies to farmers is also a concern, since 
the subsidy reaches only the 16 percent of Tamil 
Nadu farmers who own pump sets. The vast majority of rural households have not benefited 
directly from agricultural power subsidies because they do not own electric pump sets. The 
majority of electric pump set owners are small and marginal farmers (79.4 percent), 14 percent 
are medium farmers and 6 percent are large farmers (
Table  3.5). 
28  It is important to note, 
                                                     
 28 Households that reported cultivating crops and own le
ss than 1 hectare (Ha) were classified as marginal 
farmers, those owning 1 to less than 2 Ha were classi
fied as small farmers, those with 2 and less than 4 Ha 
are classified as medium farmers.  Households owning 
4 or more hectares are classified as large farmers. 
 32though, that insufficient new investment and main
tenance have made rural electric supply erratic 
in many places.  Surveys in other states in Indi
a indicate that farmers would be willing to pay for 
electricity, provided that it was more reliable (World Bank, 2001). 
 3.37 In 2001/2002 agricultural power consumers 
in Tamil Nadu received a subsidy of Rs 
27.09 billion.29 According to available data, total official power consumption by agricultural 
consumers was 9,484 million Kwh and the average 
cost of supplying power to farmers was Rs 
3.05/Kwh. Although small and marginal farmers c
onstitute the majority of electric pump set 
owners in Tamil Nadu, medium and large farm
ers (representing 21 percent of all agricultural 
pump set owners) receive a disproportionately larg
e share of the total agricultural power subsidy 
compared to their representation in the population 
(i.e. while medium and large farmers represent 
21% of electric pumpset owners, they operate 
48 percent of the area irrigated by electric pump 
sets) (Table  3.5).30 Poor rural households in Tamil Nadu receive less than 17% of the agricultural 
power subsidy.  Table

  3.38 In March 2003, The Tamil Nadu Electrici
ty Regulatory Commission (TNERC) 
notified its first tariff order, reducing the cross-subsidy on electricity with the introduction 
of an agricultural tariff
.  After 12 years of free power to farmers, the new tariff order has 
introduced a flat rate for unmetered connections
 of Rs.250 per HP per annum and a charge of 
Rs.0.20/kWh for metered connections. The gove
rnment also announced an income support 
scheme for small and marginal farmers.  This was 
a significant step toward creating a more direct 
and transparent system of subsidies to farmers a
nd other target groups and ensuring the separation

 30 The analysis of agricultural power subsidies in 
Tamil Nadu presented is based on data from the 54
th round (1998) of the Indian National Sample Survey (NSS).
 30 This round of the NSS
 included a module on 
Common Property Resources, Sanitation and Hygiene whic
h contained information on cultivation practices 
of households, and the ownership and use of irrigation technology (electric pumps, diesel pumps, canals, 
and conjunctive sources) in
 cultivating five principal crops. By 
using the amount of area irrigated by 
electric pumps as a proxy for the benefits of subsidized
 electricity, these data can be used to examine the 
distribution of agricultural power subsidies across vari
ous landholding categories. In reality, in addition to 
farm size, power consumption by different groups of farmers is likely to depend on the water requirements 
of crops grown, the depth of the water table, and 
the availability, reliability and quality of the power 
supply. The magnitude of agricultural power subsidies goin
g to different land holding categories can be 
estimated by combining data on the ownership of electric pump sets, the distribution of area irrigated by 
electric pumps by land holding, and an estimat
e of the total agricultural power subsidy. 
 33of commercial operation of the power utility fr
om the need for subsidy. However, the 
reintroduction of agriculture power tariff became
 a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu during 
the recent national election, forcing the governme
nt which suffered severe electoral loss for the 
national parliament seats to reverse the policy. 
 3.39 Under the income support scheme, GoTN 
provided small and marginal farmers a 
transfer of up to Rs.1250 per year.  However, this disbursement 
was restricted to Rs.1000 in the case of small and marginal farmers owning pump sets of 3 HP capacity.   These farmers, 0.94 
million, accounted for about 57% of the agricultural 
connections or 12% of farmers.  This direct 
subsidy would have amounted to 
about Rs.1 billion for farmers. 
3.40 On June 10, 2003,  the Central government 
enacted the Electricity Act 2003 (Act) which 
replaces the earlier central laws on electricity viz. the Indian Electricity Act-1910, Electricity 

Supply Act-1948, and the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act of 1998. The new act is 

expected to have a far reaching impact on the 
power sector in India (World Bank, 2003).  The 
provision for mandatory metering of supply of el
ectricity within two years will put pressure on 
States to meter agricultural consumers.  TNEB has started metering new agriculture connections 

since July 1, 2002.  Like rest of India, mete
ring the 1.65 million existing agricultural consumers 
in the state is politically challenging, and is exp
ected to take time.  However 100% metering is a 
mandatory requirement under the Act and an essential
 pre-requisite to improve the information on 
power supply and consumption.  
 Full metering of retail consump
tion along with bulk metering is 
also required to establish energy accountability among utility staff.  Metering of agriculture 

would be the first step towards better targeting of the agriculture subsidy based on actual 

consumption and provide better incentives for effi
cient usage of scarce water resources in Tamil 
Nadu.    The Impact of  Water, Agricultural Power 
and Fertilizer Subsidies on Incentives in TN 
Agriculture  3.41 Government policies have major effects on crop profitability in India
.  Trade policies (tariffs, export subsidies, and quantitative restric
tions) affect domestic market prices of local  
commodities that compete with international goods. 
 Moreover, agricultural-related subsidies (the 
national fertilizer subsidy, inadequate cost recove
ry in irrigation systems, electricity subsidies) 
and investments involve major public expenditures.     
3.42 In order to examine the impacts of major 
policies on incentives in agriculture, this 
section presents measures of crop profitability wi
th and without subsidies and other market 
distortions.  Given the importance of increasing water e
fficiency in agriculture, a major focus of 
the analysis is on the effects of changes in irriga
tion costs (water charges in canals and electricity 
charges for wells).  The impact of other major 
policies is also considered through estimates of 
crop productivity at economic prices (i.e. at pr
ices that reflect the opportunity cost of each 
resource).   3.43 The analysis is based on costs of cultiva
tion and crop budgets (average of 1999/2000 and 2000/01) as calculated from farmer surveys by th
e Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) 
for selected crops and sites.  These sites are chosen as representative of each crop under the 
irrigation system specified.  It should be noted th
at costs and returns of individual farmer fields 
depend on particular soil conditions
, local rainfall, farm management skills, and other factors.   
3.44 The amount of water used and its margin
al (operational) cost varies considerably 
across types of irrigation and crops
 (Table  3.6).  Sugar cane requires the most water (1800 
mms/unit area) and occupies the land essentially y
ear-round.  Paddy requires 135 mms/unit area 
in only 4 months. Cotton and groundnuts require le
ss than half the water of paddy.  Financial 
 34costs of irrigation to the farmer (not including capital costs) vary from about 289 Rs/ha for paddy 
under canal irrigation
31 to 1,250 Rs/ha (the annual tax on a 5 horsepower pump set) for sugar 
cane and banana.  (Pump set taxes for crops that
 are grown as part of a two-crop sequence are 
estimated as one half of the annual charges for pump sets, i.e. 625 Rs/ha.)  
3.45 Estimates of the full marginal cost of 
irrigation under meter charges vary more 
substantially, given the large variation in estimated electricity use
.  Electricity use for paddy 
irrigated solely with pumps is more than five 
times that of paddy irri
gated by tanks with only 
supplemental irrigation from pumps.  Likewise, est
imated electricity use for groundnut and cotton 
irrigation by pumps is only about half that for 
paddy given lesser water requirements.  Estimated 
economic costs of irrigation (excluding capital co
sts) for paddy irrigated by wells is about 10 
times the estimated economic costs of canal irriga
tion (4600 Rs/ha for pumps compared with 450 
Rs/ha for canals).32   3.46 Given variations in costs as well as value of
 output, net financial returns per hectare of rice, sugar cane, cotton and groundnuts unde
r various forms of irrigation range from 
9,849 Rs/ha for rice cultivation under tank and well irrigation to 17,956 Rs/ha for sugar 
cane with well irrigation (Table  3.7). These costs and financial returns of cultivation for irrigation with pumps are adjusted to include the tax on electric motors which is planned to take 
effect in late 2003.        
3.47 For well irrigation, the tax on pumpsets (a
djusted for the number of crops grown on 
the land) is equal to only 4.9 to 6.5 percent of
 net returns to land and management with no 
irrigation costs.  These figures represent the reduction in 
crop profitability in these systems if no 
direct payments are given to offset the new tax 
on pumpsets.  If a system of meters is used and 
electricity costs remain at 0.2 Rs/kw-hr, then elect
ricity charges as a percentage of returns to land 
and management with no irrgation costs actually falls to 0.8 to 2.3 percent.   

3.48 However, if electricity char
ges are raised to the estima
ted marginal economic price 
of electricity to agriculture of  3.05 Rs/Kwhr,
 electricity costs rise to about 4,600 Rs/ha for 
paddy and sugar cane, reducing returns to 
land and management by 35.9 percent for rice 
and 23.8 percent for sugar cane
.  Likewise, total returns to land,
 labor and capital (value added) 
falls sharply for paddy and sugar cane irrigated by
 wells when the cost of electricity for pumping 
is included.  If electricity is costed at its 
economic price, total income generated from cotton 
cultivation (23,949 Rs/ha) is 53 percent greater than that for rice.33   3.49 Full cost of electricity for pumping woul
d thus reduce profitability per hectare of 
rice in favor of cotton, groundnuts and other l
ess water-intensive crops
 (for which costs and 
returns are not calculated here).
  This does not imply that all, or even most of the land planted 
to rice would shift to these crops.  For example, 
current cotton area irrigated with wells is only 
about 62 thousand hectares, compared with an estimated 202 thousand hectares of rice irrigated 
with wells, but cotton may not be suited to all 
the rice land, because of drainage and other soil 
characteristics.  Marketing problems might slow shifts to other crops, as well.  Nonetheless, 

charging full cost for electricity would seriously
 change the incentives for rice production, and 
                                                     
 31 Canal water charges are those for the Cauvery delta. 
32 For pumps, the economic cost of el
ectricity is assumed to be 3.1 Rs
/kw-hour.  For can
als, the economic 
cost of water is assumed to be 450 Rs/ha.  Note that
 these figures do not include the cost of capital of the 
pumps, however. 
33 Note that if the farmer hires outside labor or rents the land, farm income will be less than total value 
added. 
 35promote water conservation. Water thus saved w
ould be available for more productive uses either 
in agriculture, for household consumption, or industrial use.

 37 3.50 Fertilizer is also subsidized: farmer prices of urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 
potash (K20) are 33, 5 and 48 percent below estimated border prices, respectively.
34  These 
subsidies significantly affect profitability: estimated
 fertilizer subsidies per hectare range are 810 
to 914 Rs/hectare for paddy and 2408 Rs/hectare for s
ugar cane (Table 3.8), equivalent to 6.6 to 
9.3 percent of net financial returns for paddy a
nd 13.4 percent of net fina
ncial returns for sugar 
cane. 3.51 Total input subsidies (both irrigation and f
ertilizer) thus account for 32.0 percent of 
net financial returns (calculated with a flat rate
 cost of electricity/irrigation) of sugar cane 
and 39.2 percent of net financial returns to paddy under well irrigation.
  The share of total input subsidy for other crops is much smaller: (9
.5 to 15.2 percent).  Net returns for cotton and 
groundnuts at economic prices of fertilizer and 
water are about 13,600 Rs/hectare, 1.9 times higher than those of paddy cultivated with well i
rrigation and 1.27 times higher than sugar cane. 
3.52 Current charges for irrigation (electricity co
sts) for paddy cultivated with tubewells 
in Tamil Nadu (Rs 625/ha) are less than irrigatio
n costs per hectare of paddy cultivated in 
other major rice producing states in India (Figure 3.4).
  These electricity costs are only two-
thirds average irrigation costs in Andhra Pradesh and 45 percent of irrigation costs in Punjab.  If 
full costs of irrigation were charged for tubewells, in Tamil Nadu (Rs 4,625/ha) , however, these 
costs would be 2.3 and 3.4 times the irrigation cost
s per hectare of paddy cultivated in Punjab and 
Haryana, respectively.   
3.53 Comparisons of gross profits per hectare of rice cultivation between Tamil Nadu 
and other states nonetheless suggest that there 
is ample scope for a moderate increase in 
electricity charges.
  Gross profits per hectare of rice cu
ltivation using C1 costs (i.e. returns to 
land and management) for Tamil Nadu (well irri
gation) are 5.3 percent higher than the AP 
average.  Charging a flat rate cost for electri
city/pump makes returns for TN/wells essentially 
equal to average returns for AP (12,261 vs 12,242 Rs/ha).  Charging full irrigation/electricity 
costs for TN/wells reduces returns to 8260 Rs/ha, comparable to West Bengal (8,279 Rs/ha).
35                                                      
 34 Border prices of fertilizer are calculated using 
the 2010 World Bank Commodity forecasts for world 
prices (expressed in 2002 prices) and the December 
2002 nominal exchange rate.  Freight and marketing 
costs are from Gulati and Narayanan (2003, Table A3.2).   
35 Yields in Tamil Nadu are below those of AP and Punjab (4.0-4.1 tons/ha versus 4.8 and 5.1 tons/ha), but 
average output price in Tamil Nadu is 
higher than AP (5.9 vs 5.5 Rs/kg) and especially Punjab (4.8 Rs/kg).  
Varietal differences account for some 
of the price difference.  Note that measures of financial returns are 
greatly influenced by output prices and yields which may vary from year to year.

  Technology  3.54 The prevailing water scarcity in Tamil Nadu has provided impetus for the adoption 
of drip and sprinkler irrigation technology
. Today the state along with Maharashtra is one of 
the leading adopters of drip irrigation technology in India.  In 2002, 72,816 hectares in Tamil 
Nadu (slightly more than 1 percent of net sown
 area) was cultivated under drip and sprinkler 
irrigation (GoTN, Agriculture Policy Note, 2003-04).  These water-saving technologies are 
primarily used for horticultural, fruit and flow
er crops including Coconut, Grapes, Banana, 
Cashew, Citrus, Guava, Mango, Pomegranate, Sa
pota. The potential water savings from the use 
of drip irrigation as opposed to conventional well 
irrigation have been estimated to be large, 
ranging from 39 percent for tomatoes to as much as 68 percent for papaya  (Muthuchamy, 
Palanisami and Rajagoapl, 2000).  The government 
is also trying to promote the use of drip 
irrigation for sugar cane cultivated under private mills. 
 3.55 The cost of  a micro-irrigation system depends on the crop, spacing, water 
requirements and the distance from the water source
. The cost of installing drip irrigation is 
estimated to range from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 
per hectare for wide spaced crops such as coconut and mangos to Rs 60,000 to 75,000 for cl
ose spaced crops such as sugarcane, cotton, 
vegetables etc.     The high capital cost of dr
ip irrigation poses a constraint to widespread 
 40adoption by marginal and small fa
rmers although the use of this technology has been encouraged 
though the provision of centrally funded subsidies to farmers. 
Environmental Management 
 3.56 An environmental action plan (EAP) has been drawn up with the aim of fully 
integrating environmental management in pl
anning, investment and management of the State's water resources
. A key element of the EAPs was 
to strengthen WRO's environmental 
monitoring and analysis capabilities via the creati
on of specialist Environmental Units/Cells. Two 
such units have been established in the main pl
anning departments (basin- and project-level).

  414. Public Expenditures and Agricultural Extension Public Expenditures on Agriculture and Irrigation 
 4.1 Agriculture related public expenditures in
 Tamil Nadu (expenditures on agriculture 
and allied activities and irrigation) as a share of agricultural GSDP are higher than most 
major agricultural states in India (World Bank, 2003b)
. These expenditures (both capital and 
revenue) totaled Rs 17 Billion in 2002/03. Be
tween 1998-2000 agricultural expenditures have 
accounted for approximately 11 percent of to
tal Agricultural GSDP in Tamil Nadu; the 
comparable figure across Indian states was 7.8 percent.
36 In Tamil Nadu agriculture related 
capital expenditures are relatively low compared 
to the all-India average, although revenue 
expenditures as a share of Agricultural GSDP 
are significantly higher than most major 
agricultural states in India. This is a situation 
for concern since capital investments are important 
for future growth, furthermore a large share of 
revenue expenditures are incurred on staff salaries 
and the food and irrigation subsidies 
leaving operating expenses under funded. 
4.2 In 2002 capital expenditures on agriculture and allied activities and irrigation 
accounted for 4.3 percent and 13.5 percent of the total capital outlay of  Rs 22.1 billion in 

Tamil Nadu, respectively
.  Of a total revenue expenditure of Rs 268.62 billion approximately 5 
percent  (Rs 13.02 billion) was spent on agricultu
re and allied activities and 1.5 percent was spent 
on irrigation and flood control (Rs 3.96 billion)
. Total expenditures (capital and revenue 
expenditures) on agriculture and allied activities 
during the 1990s exhibited a slight downward 
trend with an average annual growth rate of Œ1.1 percent while total expenditures on irrigation 
have grown at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent (
Figure  4.1:). Gross capital formation in 
agriculture increased by 15 percent in during th
e 1990s and this growth was primarily due to 
private capital formation which grew by almost
 16 percent between 1989/90  and  1998/99.

      4.3 During the 1990s, the share of agricultura
l and allied expenditures devoted to crop 
husbandry has declined, while expenditures on
 animal husbandry, dairy development and 
agricultural research and education have increased
. In 2001 expenditures on crop husbandry 
represented the single largest category of e
xpenditures on agricultural and allied activities accounting for approximately 45 percent of expenditures (
Table  4.1).  Expenditures on animal 
husbandry, dairy development and agricultural resear
ch and education averaged  8.8 percent, 3.2 
percent and 7.1 percent of total expenditures on agriculture and allied activities, respectively. 
Real expenditures on crop husbandry have decrease
d by an average annual rate of 2.4 percent 
during the 1990s, while expenditures on dairy de
velopment, agricultural research and education 
and irrigation have increased by an average annual 
rate of 12 percent, 4.2 percent and 6 percent, 
respectively.

  43Tamil Nadu™s Public Distribution System  4.4 Tamil Nadu™s Targeted Public Distribution Sy
stem (TPDS) is one the  central pillars of the state™s strategy to ensure food security
.  Under the TPDS, eligible households can purchase 
a specified amount of  food grains and other essential commodities at subsidized prices from a 
network of public distribution outlets, known as Fa
ir Price shops, throughout the state.  Of the 18 
GoI essential commodities, four commodities na
mely, rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene are 
supplied through the public distribution system (PDS) in TN.  Ooty tea and Iodised salt are also 

sold through the PDS in the state. Beginning in July 2002, TN introduced some significant 
reforms to its PDS to address fiscal concerns 
the main elements of which included a coupon 
system to eliminate leakages, decentralized procur
ement, and restructuring of the issue price of 
rice.   4.5 Although substantive PDS reforms were undert
aken between 2002 to 2003, these reforms 
have recently suffered a setback. Rice coupons 
introduced to reduce the number of households 
eligible for PDS rice have been abolished by th
e GoTN after the national election in April-May 
2004. Income criteria to determine PDS e
ligibility have also been withdrawn. 
4.6 Coverage of TPDS in Tamil Nadu has been significantly higher than in the majority of 
Indian states.  In 1999/00 85 percent of BPL house
holds in Tamil Nadu were estimated to use the 
TPDS, a 14% increase since 1993/94.  The propor
tion of APL households accessing TPDS is also 
high in Tamil Nadu with approximately 66%
 of APL households accessing TPDS shops in 
1999/00 (Deininger, Umali-Deininger and Tritah, 2003). 

4.7 Under the TPDS system operating in TN (t
hrough August 2003), households had the option 
of  drawing rice from the PDS or additional quantitie
s of sugar or kerosene in lieu of rice.  Based 
on the family™s choice, a different colored 
family card is issued.  As of March 2003, 
approximately 16 million family cards had been i
ssued in the state of which 84.7 percent were 
rice cards (pink cards), 8.1 percent were kerosen
e cards (yellow cards), 7 percent were sugar 
cards (yellow cards) and 0.2 percent were kero
sene cards issued to police (khaki cards). 
Approximately 4.6 percent of households in the 
state qualified under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana 
(AAY), a scheme sponsored by the Government of India which targets the poorest households in 
the state enabling them to draw food grains at 
a specially subsidized ra
te specified by GoI. 
4.8 As part of its reform efforts the GoTN ha
d attempted to reduce the number of bogus cards 
that had come into circulation in the state by introducing a coupon system for drawing rice from 

the PDS. Twelve million rice card holders were 
issued coupons. Coupons were only issued to the 
person whose photograph has been affixed to th
e family card. The coupon as well as the family 
card were needed to withdraw rice.   
4.9 Each rice cardholder was entitled to draw 
a specified quantity from the PDS system depending on their family size
.  The maximum monthly issue amount was 20 Kgs for a family 
with ﬁ3 or more unitsﬂ. 37 Families that opted for a yellow card were eligible for an additional 3 
Kgs of sugar or 5 litres of kerosene per month in lieu 
of rice.  In the Nilgiris district, card holders were entitled to an additional 4 Kgs of rice per 
month in addition to the normal entitlement.  All 
AAY households were eligible to draw 35Kgs of rice per month irrespective of family size.   
4.10 Family cardholders in the city and district headquarters could draw 10 Kg of wheat and 
those in rural areas could draw 5Kg each month 
in addition to the rice entitlement.  Each family 
cardholder was also eligible to receive 500 gram
s per head up to a maximum of 2 Kgs per card 
per month.  Those who opted for yellow cards we
re entitled to an additional 3 Kg of sugar per

  44month in addition to their regular entitlement. Ke
rosene was supplied to cardholders on the basis 
of the number of LPG connections they had and wa
s also supplied to some public institutions and 
hospitals through the PDS system.   
4.11 Food grains in the public distribution system are sold to the public through a network of 
Fair price shops that are run by the TN Civil S
upplies Corporation. Private traders are not allowed 
to operate these shops. Each revenue village has a 
fair price shop and the government™s policy is 
to try to ensure that no card holder should  have
 to walk more than 2 km to reach a fair price 
shop.  There is an additional stipulation that th
e maximum number of cards attached to a shop 
should not exceed 800 in urban areas and 500 in rural 
areas.  In very remote areas, or areas where 
the existing fair price shops has to serve more 
than the maximum stipulated number of family 
cards, women™s groups are allowed to distribute PDS commodities. 
4.12 The PDS rice requirement is met through allotm
ents made by the GoI (allotment from the 
Central Pool) and paddy procurement within th
e state. In October 2002 the state adopted a 
decentralized procurement system under whic
h the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation 
procures rice on behalf of FCI at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the GoI.  TNCSC 
procures paddy by opening Direct Purchase Centr
es in the Cauvery Delta Area and through taluk 
godowns in other areas, on behalf of the GoI. The pa
ddy that is procured is  converted into rice by 
the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, stored 
in its godowns and issued in the PDS outlets.  
TNCSC adheres to the  quality norms of FCI a
nd the paddy procured by the state may be re-
allotted to the state as part of the GoI allotment to the state.  The difference between the central 
issue price and the economic cost of rice (set by 
GoI) is reimbursed to the state for the central 
pool allocation of rice. If the quantity procured falls short of the allocation from the central pool 

the balance will be allocated from the central pool 
and if the quantity procured is in excess of the 
requirement for the PDS it will be taken over to the central pool. 
4.13 In 2002/03 the GoI allocation to the state was 495 thousand tons per month.  The 
allocation varies by month and the allocation from th
e central pool is more than adequate to meet 
the requirement of rice under the PDS .  The ce
ntral issue price of rice under TPDS is Rs. 5.65 
per kg of BPL rice and Rs. 8.30 per kg for  APL rice.  The GOI also allows states to charge an 
additional 50 paise per kg to cover costs of trans
portation, storage cost etc.  The economic price 
of rice  obtained by the TN CSC is approximately Rs 12 per kg. As of October 1, 2002 the state 
has adopted a two tier-pricing system for issuing rice whereby the first 10 kgs of rice is sold for 
Rs 3.50 per kg,  any amount above 10 kg is sold for Rs 6 per kg.  The PDS issue price of rice for 

AAY families is Rs 3 per kg.   4.14 Sugar required for the PDS is met out of the 
allotment of levy sugar by the GoI and by 
purchases of non-levy sugar from Tamil Nadu Co-ope
rative Sugar Federation.  For Kerosene the 
state is restricted to the allocation made by th
e GoI.  GoI supplies APL wheat to Tamil Nadu at 
Rs 6.10 per kg.  As of July 2002, TN has been
 selling this wheat though its PDS system at Rs 
7.50 per kg.  The retail price of sugar issued through the PDS was  Rs 13.50 per kg.  If the state 
has to procure non-levy sugar to meet requirements,
 the state government has to bear the costs.  
The issue price of kerosene was Rs 8.40-Rs 9 pe
r litre.  GoI recommends that the issue price 
under the PDS should be between Rs 9-Rs 9.60. 
 The difference in cost is met by the GoTN. 
4.15 As a result of the reforms of the pub
lic procurement system, the GOTN had 
estimated that the food subsidy would be 
dramatically reduced from Rs.1500 crore in 
2001/02 to projected Rs.700 crore in 2003/04, a reduction of Rs. 800 crore
.  Cessation of local 
procurement (except on behalf of the FCI) reduced government expenditures on procurement by 
eliminating the costs of the extra procurement in
centives paid and the costs of milling the paddy 
into rice.  State procurement of paddy in 
2000/01 and 2001/02 were 2.
61 and 1.24 million tons, 
respectively, (equivalent to 1.75 and 0.83 million t
ons of rice).  For this procurement the paid 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  45incentives and ﬁincidental chargesﬂ of Rs. 350 to 
400 per ton (a bonus of about 7.2 percent of the 
GOI procurement price of fine rice).  In total, these costs were approximately Rs 101 crore in 
2000/01 and Rs 50 crore in 2001/02 (Table 4.2).  
4.16 The bulk of the savings on food subsidies, however, were achieved through 
reduction in number of cards (and ultimately the sales of rice), and in the subsidy per 
kilogram of rice sold
.  Total ration sales dropped from 2.10 million tons in 2000/01 to 1.62 
million tons in 2002/03.   In addition the unit s
ubsidy paid by the GOTN fell by 64 percent from 
Rs. 5.13 /kg to Rs/ 1.85 as the average sales price 
rose from Rs 3.0/kg to an
 estimated Rs 4.07/kg, 
and the average cost of rice from the GOI fell 
from Rs 8.13/kg to Rs. 5.92/kg.  (This reduction in 
the average cost was due to an increase in the a
llocation of BPL rice and a lowering of the cost of APL rice.)  Thus, the    reduction in the subsidy 
due to reforms in distribution was about Rs 7.79 
billion (Rs 779 crore).  The total estimated reduction in subsidy (combined 
effect of reforms on 
procurement and distribution) was thus about 
Rs. 8.80 billion (Rs 880 crore), (Table 4.3). 
4.17 Effective 1 September 2003, the two-tiered pricing of rice according to the amount of 
ration purchased was scheduled to e
nd, with the entire ration to be so
ld at Rs. 3.5/kg.  As a result, 
if the quantity sold through ration shops remains at an average of 135 thousand tons per month, 
revenues will fall (and the subsidy will incr
ease) by Rs 0.93 billion (Rs 93 crore or about $21 
million), equivalent to 11 percent of the total s
ubsidy reduction of Rs. 8.
80 billion, shown above.  
If quantity of rice sold per card rises to 16 kgs/
card, the increase in costs relative to 2002/03 
would be Rs. 3.74 crore (about $84 million). The 
implications of the most recent policy reforms 
following the national election in April-Ma
y 2004 remain to be examined.   
Agricultural Extension  4.18 The agricultural extension system in TN is still organized around a modified 
Training and Visitation (T&V) extension approac
h, but with reduced levels of in-service 
training and fewer farmer visits
.  It is important to note that T&V Extension projects only 
strengthened the Department of Agriculture™s 
(DOA) extension system; extension programs in 
the other line departments, including Horticu
lture (DOH), Animal Husbandry (DAH), Fisheries 
(DOF), etc., were not improved.  Therefore, 
Tamil Nadu™s basic, multip
le agency extension 
structure remaining largely intact since the introduction of T&V Extension in the 1980s.  In short, 
each line department is still responsible for its
 own extension staff and programs, with little 
coordination at any level.  Also, since state government funding primarily goes for salaries and 
personal emoluments, most extension activities 
across all line departments are funded through 
ﬁtop-downﬂ central government schemes, plus ot
her subsidy and incentive programs that the 
extension field staff are expected to implement. 

 
4.19 New agricultural development priorities in Tamil Nadu are likely to bring about 
changes in the extension system
.  The GOTN has recognized the income generating and value-
added possibilities of the horticulture, sericulture, 
livestock and fisheries sectors.  In the Tenth 
Plan period there is an emphasis on horticultu
ral development, including agro-processing and 
marketing.  For example, the districts of Dhar
mapuri (Hussur), Nilgiri (Ooty) and Madurai have 
been earmarked for mango development, both fo
r processing and export.  The Agriculture and 
Processed Foods Export Development Authority (APEDA) is assisting the state in this venture.  
In addition, the GOTN plans to strengthen research
 and extension for the development of other horticultural crops, including fruit, 
vegetable and floriculture crops, plus cashews and medicinal 
plants.  This program is expected to focus on the organization and management of new supply 

chains, including domestic and export market de
velopment and investigating the feasibility of 
different types of value-added processing.  Since the GOTN has very limited extension capacity 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  46for horticulture development, it plans to li
nk agricultural, horticulture and agricultural 
engineering extension systems/units.

   48 4.20 Increasing public-private partnerships and pr
ivate sector involvement in extension 
is an encouraging development in the state.
  Public-private partnerships are also planned as 
industrial houses cooperate with extension by 
focusing on agricultural export and value-added 
processing opportunities.  For example, the New 
Anna Marumalarchi Thittam is focusing on 
small scale agro-industries.  Some industries bei
ng considered include edible oil extraction, paddy 
hulling, cashew processing, extraction of coconut oil, ice cream making, etc.  To date, no 
sustained expansion in the marketing of horticultural crops has taken place because extension has 
not been reorganized, strengthened and given a ne
w mandate for organizing farmer organizations 
that can systematically supply these planned new 
value chains.  If the ATMA model  (see Box 
4.1) could be introduced into Tamil Nadu, a more
 coordinated and systematic extension program 
could be organized at the district and bl
ock level to develop 
production and marketing 
arrangements for high-value commodities and to 
organized value-added processing enterprises.  
4.21 The state could also draw on a variety of 
international experiences with transforming 
extension systems into more client responsive ser
vices.  For example, Chile introduced a system 
of contracting private service providers in 1978, 
involving farmer organizations that propose 
defined projects for commercialization and mode
rnization of small-farm agriculture at a 
decentralized level.  In Keny
a, the Agricultural Technology and Information Response Initiative 
implemented by the Kenyan Agricultural Research
 Institute since 2000, provides grants averaging 
$3000 to farmers organizations or community-bas
ed organizations to finance acquisition of technologies, exchange visits to other farmers, and visits by institu
te staff.  Similarly, Bangladesh 
provided funding ($1,500 per year) to 
upazilas (sub-districts) to promote collaboration between 
public and private agencies through an average of
 four to five small-scale projects in each sub-
district (World Bank, 2004b).   
4.22 One innovative public-private sector initiative involves the disseminating of 
extension information to farmers through th
e use of internet kiosks in rural areas
.  The 
system allows farmers to obtain up-to-date 
information on major crop prices, advances in 
production technologies, as well as other information on various social services including schools 
and health facilities. Through these kiosks, called Pa
rry™s Corners, farmers can also send their 
queries regarding agricultural problems faced in th
e field to extension workers in the Department of Agriculture and researchers at the Tamil Nadu 
Agricultural University.  The kiosk attendant 
owns a digital camera that can be used to photogr
aph crop damage, pests inf
estations etc.  These photographs can then be transmitted to researcher
s and extension workers for diagnosis. This 
strategy has been successful in prompting ear
ly responses to several outbreaks of plant and 
animal diseases.

  49 Text Box  4.1:  The ATMA Approach to Extension 
 Several states in India have m
oved away from the T&V approach to
 a more decentralized extension 
approach that integrates extension programs across the major line departments, and introduces 
participatory, bottom-up planning procedures, resulting the creation of a more responsive, transparent 
and accountable extension system. In the mid-1990s the Government of India and the World Bank 

undertook a systematic assessment of the post-T&V Extension situation and then carried out a pilot 
project under the Innovations in Technology Dissemination (ITD) component of the National 
Agricultural Technology Project (NATP).  This proj
ect, which was launched in 1998, was designed to 
field-test a new extension model that focused 
on improving farm income through agricultural 
diversification.  The new model involved decentrali
zed, restructured and reoriented extension activities 
at the district and block levels through a new institution called the Agricultural Technology 
Management Agency, or ATMA.  (In Hindi, ATMA 
means ﬁsoul;ﬂ therefore, this new institution was 
to become the 
soul of agricultural development
 within each district.)  This ATMA approach has now 
been pilot tested in 28 project districts across 7 st
ates.  As a result of the successes achieved, in 2002 
the Government of India (GOI) adopted a new 
Policy Framework for Agricultural Extension
 that 
endorsed this new integrated approach. 

 
The new extension system promoted through the 
ATMA model places more 
emphasis on agricultural 
diversification and improving rural incomes.  The GOI™s new extension policy reflects the current 

agricultural development situation in India.  First, there is recognition that the country has achieved 

food security; therefore,
 extension priorities need to shift towards agricultural diversification and 
improving rural household income.  Second, this new 
policy recognizes that a) the private sector is 
assuming more responsibility for extension activities related to the major food and commercial crops; 
b) most productivity gains associated with high yielding varieties have already been exploited, 
therefore, further investments in DOA extension w
ill result in minimal returns on investment; and c) 
hunger in India today is essentially a poverty problem, therefore, further investments in field crop 
extension will do little to alleviate rural poverty and hunger. 
 
Given the successes achieved through the ATMA model, the GOI now recognizes that there is 
considerable scope to increase rural household income and reduce rural poverty by focusing on high 
value crop and livestock enterprises, including value-added processing.  This new policy agenda 

reflects a shift in focus from extension promoting field crop technology (i.e. supply driven), to a new 
focus on market driven opportunities for high value commodities.  In addition, many project districts 
have been successful in building ﬁsocial capitalﬂ by organizing and mobilizing rural women and 

unemployed young farmers to undertake these high value commodities and enterprises.  
 The combination of new goals, a decentralized approa
ch and a new integrated structure has created new 
enthusiasm for a public extension system that is more responsive to rural people and capable of 
increasing rural household income.  In addition, th
e ATMA framework provides mechanisms for cost 
recovery and strengthening research-extension linkages.  The combination of Block Technology Teams 
(BTTs), Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) and Farmer
 Associations (FAs) is also a more effective 
approach in disseminating information on specific high value commodities and/or enterprises. , making 

it possible to to reduce the long-term cost of extension by phasing out village extension workers 
through attrition. 
  505. Agricultural Markets and Market Policies  5.1 Development of agricultural markets will be 
essential for agricultural diversification 
and accelerated farmer income growth
.  Significant reforms in markets have taken place in 
recent years, giving a larger role to the priv
ate sector and removing movement restrictions. 
Promising institutional developments in marketing in
clude an expansion of contract farming, long 
established for sugar cane, which has begun on 
a small scale through private sector initiatives in 
cotton, gherkins (cucumbers), poultry and rice.   
5.2 As in most states of India, the public sector has historically played a major role in 
Tamil Nadu™s agricultural markets.  The initiatives of the government focused on framing rules 
and regulations to ensure fair trade practices, 
establishing institutional markets, building storage 
and warehousing facilities, creating institutions fo
r standardization and grading, and building 
awareness among farmers regarding the public ma
rketing infrastructure that was provided. 
5.3 Government intervention in markets 
involved three major channels: direct 
procurement and sales, regulated markets, and cooperatives.
  In Tamil Nadu, the government 
intervened directly in paddy, rice, sugar and cotton markets through 
direct procurement and 
sales.  It also placed restrictions on private trade, and set up 
regulated markets
 to facilitate 
transactions between farmers and licensed traders
, in order to provide fair prices for farmers 
and ensure fair trading practices.  Restricti
ons on movements of commodities were designed to 
prevent sales to importing regions from causi
ng shortages in exporting regions.  Licensing 
requirements helped the government monitor tr
aders and limit their scales of operation.  
Cooperatives were actively encouraged and had si
gnificant roles in milk markets.  
Private trade in unregulated markets
 operated only on a small scale, mainly at the village level, yet accounted 
for the large majority of sales of most crops other than paddy and sugar cane . 
5.4 Significant reforms have taken place in the 1990s in Tamil Nadu, increasing the role 
of the private sector in general.  
The scale of direct procurement of paddy has been reduced 
(and the GOTN no longer procures paddy on its
 own account), though regulated markets and 
cooperative sectors continue.  More recently, 
the GOTN has actively encouraged private 
marketing through lifting of stock and movement 
restrictions for rice, waiving of the cess on 
cotton sales, promotion of contract farming,
 and planned investments in rural market 
infrastructure.  Market Structure: Regulated and Private Markets 
 5.5 Tamil Nadu has 270 regulated markets
 and 15 sub-markets, located at major assembling 
centers, managed by 16 market committees at district level.
  At the top of the organizational 
structure is the state-level 
Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, 
an autonomous 
and advisory body that helps the market comm
ittees to organize and implement development 
activities, and plans for improvements in marketing of
 agricultural produce in the state. It is also 
responsible for development of infrastructural facilities at market committee level, enabling 
publicity and propaganda activities of the regulated
 markets,  and training the market committee 
personnel.  5.6 Market committees
 are headed by a chairman who is
 selected from among the members. 
The market committees collect ce
ss for the marketed agricultu
ral produce in their respective defined operational areas. Market cess for the sale 
of notified commodities, whether sold within 
the premises of regulated markets or outside, we
re increased from 0.45 per cent to one per cent 
during the last decade. Selling notified commodities 
within the premises of regulated market is 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  51purely voluntary. Tax assessments on sales outside
 of regulated markets are based on sales 
declarations of traders to tax collectors. Traders who pay the cess on their sales outside of 
regulated markets receive no direct benefit from the 
regulated markets.  For these traders, the cess 
functions as a general sales tax. 5.7 The regulated markets have been provided with infrastructural facilities like godowns, 
commercial grading centres and drying yards. We
lfare schemes to encourage farmers to bring 
their produce to regulated markets such as pl
edge loans and Tamil Nadu Farmers Development 
Welfare Scheme are also operated.  
5.8 Overall, regulated markets account for only about 10 percent of the total value of 
sales of all foodgrains. For the  major crops  with significan
t sales in regulated markets (paddy, 
maize, ragi, green and black gram, groundnuts,
 sesame, turmeric and cotton) these markets 
account for only 15 percent of the value of production.)
 (Table  5.1).
  There are large variations 
across region and by commodity, however, with re
gulated markets in Cuddalore, Villupuram and 
Thiruvannamalai districts (northeast zone) having high volumes of transactions and markets in 
Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli districts (southern zone) with relatively few transactions.  Surveys by the Department of 
Agricultural Economics, Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University indicate that farmers are aware of th
e regulated market, but that small and marginal 
farmers with very small marketable surplus tend 
to sell their produce to village traders.   
5.9 Regulated markets account for a higher percentage of sales of turmeric (42 percent), 
sesame (55 percent).
  Market committees for turmeric in Erode and Trichy districts (western 
zone and Cauvery delta) have been particularly
 successful in spurring production, sales and 
exports.   5.9 Marketing through Primary Co-operative 
Marketing Societies (PCMS) account for 
an even smaller share of trade (Table 5.2).  
Through the PCMS at the local (taluk) level, the 
Tamil Nadu Co-operative Marketing Federation 
(TANFED) procures cotton, paddy, chilly, 
sunflower seeds, coriander, blackgram and other cr
ops.  It thus acts as an agent of the National 
Agricultural Marketing Federation of India (
NAFED) to provide price support and promote 
exports.  The PCMS also assists member farmers in processing, storing and marketing their 
agricultural produce, in some instances providing
 credit, arranging auction sales, or directly 
purchasing agricultural produce.  The total value of the produce marketed through the 
cooperatives has increased over time (Table  5.3) mainly due to marketing of cotton and 
sugarcane.   5.10 In 1999, the Tamil Nadu Government established Farmers Markets (
Uzhavar 
Sandhai) for fruits and vegetables to reduce marketing costs between growers and 
consumers.
  At present nearly 100 Farmers Markets are 
functioning in the state, in parallel with other marketing channels.   
5.10 Small village markets (shandies) provide
 markets for sales and purchases of 
agricultural commodities, as well as agricultural inputs consumer goods.  On an average, 
each shandy caters to a geographical area of a
bout 15 square kilometers. and a population of 
about 30,000 spread over about 25 villages.  The total volume of marketable surplus of 
agricultural commodities passing through the periodi
c markets in India is somewhere between six 
and twenty per cent of the surplus.

  Rice Markets 
 5.11 For three decades, from the early 1960s to
 the early 1990s, the state government 
controlled the majority of paddy trade, procur
ing paddy for the public distribution system.  
In the early 1960s, the state procured five bags 
of paddy (65 kgs each) per hectare, for all the 
farms having about one hectare under paddy. Later, 
this was restricted to the Cauvery Delta zone 
(zone IV) under the monopoly procurement scheme, 
by which the entire marketable surplus of 
paddy in the region was to be sold only to the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation.  
5.12 In 1993-94, a system of parallel procurement was introduced for paddy which 
continues to date.  
 Under the system of parallel procurem
ent, farmers have the option to sell 
their marketable surplus of paddy either to 
the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation at 
procurement prices or to private traders at market prices. Since October 2002, the state 
government has not procured rice on its own beha
lf, but instead the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies 
Corporation procures rice on behalf of the F
ood Corporation of India at the Minimum Support 
Price (MSP) fixed by the GoI.  Unlike in most other states of India, neither the Food Corporation 

of India nor the state government procures rice through a levy on rice mills.

Source: TNAU (2003).  Promoting Agricultural Development in Tamil Nadu 
 5.13 Substantial private sector rice trade takes place between Tamil Nadu and the 
neighboring states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala,
 with exports consistently 
mainly of coarse rice and imports consisting largely 
of finer rice varieties.  Movement restrictions 
preventing the export of Tamil Nadu to other stat
es, and storage restrictions for paddy/rice by 
millers and traders were also lifted during 1993-94.
38 No data on inter-state trade exists, but rough estimates of net trade can be made on the 
basis of changes in within state supply from 
production and net public distribution (incl
uding both ration sales and various employment 
programs), together with estimates of demand derived from an assumed base year demand, 

changes in real prices and incomes, and demand parameters (
Table  5.1). 
5.14 Demand estimates for various years in 
Table  5.1 use 2001/02 as a 
base, and assume that no net private trade took place in that year.  Per 
capita availability from production (less ten percent 
for seed, feed and losses) and net public distri
bution (total distribution less procurement of 
paddy/rice in Tamil Nadu) was 134.8 kgs/person in 2001/02, slightly below the average of 139.2 
kgs/person for 1997/98 to 2001/02.  Estimates of
 consumption in other years assume either 
constant per capita demand (estimate 1) or an 
own-price elasticity of demand for rice of Œ0.5 and 
an income elasticity of demand for rice of 1.0 (estimate 2).
39                                                      
 38 Note that prior to October 2002, monopoly procurement was reinstated in several years (e.g. in 1996-97 
when 922 thousand tons were procured, as well as in 1999-00 and 2000-01), in order to assure the GoTN of 
rice supplies. 39 Estimates of the income elasticity of demand for rice range from– AIDS model estimates by Kailasam 
(1991) for households in western Tamil Nadu ranged from 0.956 to 1.241 for rural household groups and 
0.695 to 1.121 for urban household groups.  Own-price elasticities ranged from Œ0.262 to -0.530 (rural) and 
-0.278 to -0.593 (urban).  Hazell and Ramasamy (1991) 
estimates of income elasticities with a pooled data 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  56 5.15 Estimates of demand and net trade indicate that, in years of normal rainfall and 
water availability, Tamil Nadu is nearly self-sufficient in rice.
  From 1997/98 to 2001/02, 
production of paddy within the state accounted 
for an estimated 89 to 95 percent of total 
consumption for the period as a whole.  During th
ese years, net public distribution averaged 1.19 
million tons, (about 15 percent of consumption), a
nd estimated average private trade net exports 
were about 300 Œ 800 thousand tons, (equal to 3 
to 10 percent of estimated consumption).   
5.16 In 2002-03 a drought year, private net rice inflows contributed an estimated 1.0-1.3 
million tons to total availability, eq
ual to 12-16 percent of consumption. 
Because of the severe drought in 2002-03, production 
of paddy fell by 2.47 million tons (a decline of 34 percent) 
compared to the average of the previous five 
years.  Net public distribution of rice was 2.15 
million tons, equal to the level of total distri
bution, since no procurement took place. Assuming 
constant per capita demand, net private trade fl
ows are estimated at 1.32 million tons, 16 percent 
of consumption.  Alternatively, adjusting for th
e higher price rise and an estimated 2.7 percent 
decline in per capita incomes relative to 2001/02, pe
r capita rice consumption fell by 2.7 percent 
and private imports were 
only about 1.0 million tons. 
5.17 Private trade flows helped stabilize market supplies and prices (
Figure  5.1).  
The influx of 1.0-1.3 million tons of rice imports from other states (and abroad) through the private 
market trade helped stabilize prices without a majo
r increase in public distribution in the state.  
Rice prices in Tamil Nadu closely traced those in A
ndhra Pradesh (a major source of private rice 
inflows to the state), reflecting the integration of 
these markets. As a result, the retail market price 
of rice in 2002/03 in Tamil Nadu was only 2.8 pe
rcent higher in real terms (nominal prices 
deflated using the GSDP deflator) than in 200
1/02 helping to maintain access to food for poor 
consumers.  5.18 The experience of 2002/03 suggests that private rice flows can play a major role in 
stabilizing rice prices and supplies in drought ye
ars, even apart from major increases in net 
public distribution.  Given these private rice flows, made po
ssible in part by the overall rice 
supply and demand balance in India as a whole, self-sufficiency in rice is not a prerequisite for 
food security in the state.  Nonetheless, availa
bility of low-cost rice through the PDS, coupled 
with employment schemes remains important for th
e welfare of poor households, particularly in 
drought years. 
Markets for Sugar Cane and Milk 
 5.19 Marketing of sugar cane to sugar mills 
involves contract farming arrangements between farmers and the state™s  sugar mills (2 public sector mills operated by the Tamil Nadu Sugar Corporation Limited, 16 cooperative sector mi
lls, and 19 private sector mills).  The total crushing capacity of these 38 mills is 104,550 to
ns crushing per day (TCD) and about 19.0 
million tons per year. During the crushing season 
2001-2002, the mills operated at full capacity, 
crushing 19.14 million tons of cane, and producing 
18.39 million tons of sugar, with an average 
recovery rate of 9.61 percent. 
5.20 The contract farming system for sugar cane 
provides a floor price for sugar farmers (who 
always get at least the SMP price) and divides the benefits of high market prices between farmers 
and mills.  These explicit sales contracts also help 
to insure mills of regular supply of sugar cane. 
Under the contracting system for sugar cane, farmers receive initial payments equal to the

to the mill.  (Note that the SMP is made known 
to the farmers well in advance of the sowing 
season for sugar cane.)  When average market 
sales prices of processed sugar rise above the 
government-determined approximate average cost of
 processed sugar (the ﬁ5A priceﬂ, which is 
determined from industry average rendements
40, average processing costs, and estimated capital 
depreciation costs), a second payment is made to
 farmers, in which the sales revenues arising 
from the positive margin between th
e actual sales price and the 5A price is split evenly between 
mill and farmer.  (In Tamil Nadu, an even higher pr
ice, the State Advised Price (SAP) is paid by 
state mills, but not by private mills.)   
5.21 In Tamil Nadu, as in most of India, milk is
 sold through Milk Producers Co-operatives at 
the village level.  Farmers supply milk to the 
society at a pre-determined price based on fat 
content and solid non fat.  The society also pr
ovides technical guidance and financial assistance. 
Commodity Marketing Boards 

5.22 Commodity boards for plantation crops, su
ch as the Tea Board and Coffee Board, were established by the 
Ministry of Commerce, Government of
 India. Each Board offers various schemes to i) develop new technologies and prom
ote adoption of the same, so as to increase 
productivity, ii) provide support for various marketing 
activities, iii) to initiate efforts to promote 
exports and iv) to maintain a data 
bank and undertake extension activities. 
5.23 The Tea Board promotes tea research and exports of tea worldwide, collects and 
disseminates statistical data as well as encourag
es labor welfare programs among a host of other 
activities all aimed at ensuring the health and vibr
ancy of the world™s largest producer of tea. 
Until 1995, the Coffee Board had a monopolistic cont
rol over the marketing of coffee in India. 
However, the winds of liberalization swept the 
Indian coffee industry and since 1995, marketing 
of coffee is strictly a private sector activity. 
Contract Farming 5.24 The pace of reforms has accelerated in recen
t years and the state is now supporting 
new initiatives in contract farming and agricultural exports (Text Box  5.1).  Contract farming 
involving business agreements for purchase of output and often provision of inputs and extension advice is increasing, particularly for sugar cane,
 cotton, and horticultural crops. For medicinal 
plants, contract farming has just begun wherein the wholesaler comes in agreement with the 
farmer producers. A contract made is for an ag
reed price under the technical guidance of the 
buyer and assistance is ensured to the farm
ers in getting financial support from nationalized 
banks.  5.25 Cotton contract farming has just started 
in about 1200 hectares in 2002-03 season 
and it is expanding. 
The only difference is that the farmers 
have the option to sell cotton to the 
contractor or to any other buyer under the market
 prices prevailing during harvest period. For the 
services provided by the contractor, a nominal charge
 will be levied on the farmer on an unit area basis. 5.26 Gherkin cultivation and processing started in India in the early' 90s and at present 
is spread over 7,900 hectares in the three southe
rn states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and 
Andhra Pradesh.
 Although gherkins can grow virtually in any part of the country, the ideal 
conditions required for growth 
prevail in these three states where the growing season extends 
through out the year. There are about twelve companies operating in the state and each company

 in Tamil Nadu.  For broilers, firms supply 
chicks, feed, medicines and technical guidance to th
e farmers.  The firms then buy the birds when 
they are eight weeks old at a predetermined price.   
Rural Infrastructure 
 5.28 Tamil Nadu™s rural infrastructure is relative good compared to most other states in 
India, but further improvements will have high pay-offs.  
Almost 100 percent of  Hamlets  
(47, 838 out of a total of 47,853 Hamlets) in 
the state are electrified. Access to rural water supply 
is also fairly high.  Ninetly-four percent of rura
l habitations are fully covered in terms of access to 
rural water supply while the remaini
ng 6 percent are partially covered.
41Although Tamil Nadu 
has an extensive road network, further attention 
to maintenance and upgrading of rural roads in 
some regions may be warranted.

access to 40 lpcd. Partially covered habitations are ha

y of less than 40 lpcd.

  59Text Box  5.1:  Contract farming in Tamil Nadu: New Initiatives for Rice  
Contract farming involves a business agreement between a farmer and a firm in which the firm 
may provide inputs, extension services, processing and 
a ready market in return 
for a guaranteed source of 
supply of the output product.  Such arrangements 
between sugar mills and cane farmers has long been 
practiced in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India.  For other products, however, restrictions on private 
sector trade motivated by a general mi
strust of traders, along with the 
structural characteristics of output 
markets (including the inability to differentiate products by quality or brand) have greatly limited the 
scope of contract farming.    
 Contract farming offers several potential benefits: it 
can reduce market risk for both farmers and firms, 
facilitate technology adoption as firms with access to capital an
d knowledge of new production 
technologies have an incentive to assist farmers in improving quality and productivity, and enhance 
quality of the final product, increasing value addition in
 processing.  Potential adverse implications of 
contract farming exist as well, though, since there is a possibility that firms may acquire significant 

market power as they expand, to
 the detriment of farmers.   
 Contractual arrangements between sugar cane farmers and sugar mills have a long history in India.  

Economies of scale in sugar processing technology, ra
pid perishibility of the product (the yield of sugar 
extracted from the cane (ﬁrendementﬂ) declines sign
ificantly within days of harvesting the cane), and 
difficulties of transporting bulky sugar cane, make fi
xed contracts between local sugar mills and farmers 
desirable from an efficiency standpoint.  To pr
otect the interests of both farmers and mills, the 
Government of India 
placed marketing regulations on sugar cane
 and created a system of administered 
prices.     Beginning in a limited way in 2002/03, EID Parry to
ok tentative steps towards establishing contract 
farming in rice.  EID Parry sold approximately 60 tons of improved seeds for super fine quality ponno 

rice (enough for about 800 hectares of rice at a seed
 rate of 75 kgs/hectare)
 and provided extension 
services to sugar cane farmers who sold sugar cane to
 the firm™s sugar mill in 
Cuddalore, and were also 
wiling to grow rice.  With the improved rice technology, paddy yields were approximately 25 percent 

higher than normal yields of 3.75
 tons/hectare.  Moreover, because of
 drought, market prices were about 
20 percent higher than the previous year.   
 EID Parry later purchased the output.  In the absence of
 an explicit sales contract, though, the firm risked 
not being able to purchase supply for its rice mills. 
In 2003/04 the firm plans to make commitments to 
farmers to procure rice at market prices from farmer
s who purchase seed.  If the trial is successful, the 
firm may providing inputs on credit and establish explicit sales contracts that are binding for farmers in 
future years.  (EID Parry™s existing contracts with
 the same farmers for sugar cane may provide an 
implicit additional enforcement mechanism to deter farmer default.) 
 The entrance of large private firms 
into rice markets has only been possible with the removal of stocking 
limits (in May 2003), and other restrictions on move
ments of paddy and rice.  Availability of new seed 
and processing technology, combined with firms™ market knowledge could make contract farming 

arrangements profitable for bot
h farmers and firms.  If quality is impr
oved, and is noticeable so that rice 
achieves higher price, firms will be able to afford to 
pay higher prices, particularly if brand names can be 
established. Maintaining competition between trader
s will remain important, however, since if firms 
significantly increase their market sh
ares, monopoly power of the firms could reduce benefits for farmers.  
Institutional arrangements (such as promotion of farmer organizations) may also be needed to make sure 
small farmers benefit, as well.  
   606. Agricultural Growth and Rural Poverty  6.1 Rural poverty is concentrated amongst rural la
ndless laborers and small farmers (especially 
those without significant amounts of irrigated land)
.  The PDS is an important safety net for the 
rural poor.  Ration sales from public stocks, co
mbined with targeted public nutrition and 
employment programs, and price-stabilizing market flows of rice from neighboring states enabled 

the state to avoid serious declines in welfare of the poor during 2002-03, a year of severe drought.  

The extent to which future agricultural growth
 reduces rural poverty will depend on the degree to 
which small farmers shift to cultivation of highe
r value crops and have access to remunerative 
markets, and labor demand increases, par
ticularly in the dry seasons.      
Rural Poverty42 6.2 The latest available data indicate that th
ere were between 7 and 11 million rural poor among Tamil Nadu™s population of  62 million in 1999/00 (
Table  6.1:). 
Findings on the 
incidence of poverty in rural versus urban 
areas in Tamil Nadu vary depending on the 
methodology used to estimate poverty lines.
43 According to the official Planning Commission 
estimates, the incidence of poverty in rural areas w
as lower than that of urban areas. The adjusted 
estimates of Deaton and Drèze (2002) arrive at 
the opposite conclusion reporting an incidence of 
poverty in urban areas less than half of that in
 rural areas.  Estimates by Kijima and Lanjouw 
(2003) also find that urban poverty is below rural 
poverty.  According to Kijima and Lanjouw, the 
estimated poverty rate in 1999/00 was 31.8 percent in
 rural areas compared to a poverty rate of  
22 percent in urban areas. The same authors also
 find that Tamil Nadu was the most poor of the 
Southern states, and had a higher incidence of 
poverty than India as a whole. These findings 
differ from those of Deaton and Drèze (2002) that reveal a slightly lower incidence of poverty in 
Tamil Nadu as compared to India as a whole.

 6.3 Tamil Nadu™s rural poverty rates have declined over time.  
All three sets of poverty 
estimates report declining rural poverty rates althoug
h they differ in their estimates of the rate of 
decline. Kijima and Lanjouw™s (2003) estimates suggest a decline in rural poverty in Tamil Nadu 
between 1993/94 and 1999/00 of about 6.7 per
centage points compared to a decline of 14.2 
                                                     
 42 This section draws heavily on the Tamil Nadu Poverty Note:  Poverty in the 1990s, A Preliminary 
Profile and Emerging Issues by Peter Lanjouw, Rajshri Jayaraman and Yoko Kijima.  The Tamil Nadu 
poverty note provides an analysis of poverty issues in the state drawing on existing household survey data 
and village studies.  This section summarizes some of the main findings of the poverty note pertaining to 
the incidence and profile of rural poverty in the state. 
43 Refer to Lanjouw et al., 2003 for a detailed summary of the various methods and their findings. 
   61percentage points reported by Deaton and Drèze (2002).  The official Planning Commission 
estimates suggest a decline in the rura
l poverty rate of 12.3 percent.  
6.4 The limited data on rural poverty over ti
me suggests a correlation with labor and 
land productivity growth, though no definitive conclusions are possible
.  From 1987/88 to 
1999/00, rural poverty decreased from 45.6 to 20.6 
percent.  During this same period, land 
productivity grew by 3.9 percent per year and 
labor productivity increased by 3.3 percent per 
year.  Given the importance of returns to land fo
r small farm incomes a
nd labor earnings for all 
rural poor households, these gains in land and labor productivity certainly contributed to raising 
rural incomes.  However, since non-agricultura
l incomes also account for a large share of 
incomes of the poor, more data and analysis at th
e household level (ideally 
with panel data sets) would be required to quantify the effect of
 agricultural productivity gains on rural poverty.

   6.5 There are marked regional variations in the 
rural poverty with a higher incidence of 
rural poverty in the Coastal North and South
. The incidence of  rural poverty  (according to 
the Lanjouw and Kijima estimates) appears to
 be higher in the Coastal North and South.
44 Between 1993/4 and 1999/0, poverty fell in all N
SSO regions with the exception of the Coastal 
North, where the poverty incidence, based on th
e Kijima-Lanjouw adjustment methodology, is 
estimated to have risen from 21 percent to 29 percent. 
6.6 The rural poor in Tamil Nadu typically own 
less land than the non-poor and are highly represented among the marginal landowners.
   Rural poverty is concentrated among those with 
marginal landholdings, and is lowest among tho
se with relative large landholdings. The incidence 
of poverty appears to be lower among the landl
ess (non-agricultural households) as compared to 
marginal landholder (those with less than 0.4 
hectares of land). Access to land alone does not

Villupuram, Cuddalore.  South districts include Tiru
chirapalli, Parambalur, Ariy
alur, Karur, Nagapattinam, 
Thiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai. Coastal districts include  Dindigul, Madurai, Theni, Virudhunagar, 
Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukkudi, Tirunelveli, Kanniyakumari.  Inland districts include 

Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri. These regional classifications are based on the 
National Sample Survey Organization™s regional zonal classifications.

Note:  Poverty rates are based on the unadjus
ted official Planning Commission poverty lines 
which overestimate the decline in poverty rates due
 to non-comparability of
 the expenditure data 
between the 55th round and previous rounds of the NSS. 
   62allow rural households to escape poverty. Estimates from 1999/00 reveal that 20 percent of  
households owning more than 4 hectares of land
 were poor  (fell in the bottom two quintiles of 
per capita consumption) compared to an pove
rty incidence of 45 percent among marginal 
landholders.  6.7 In Tamil Nadu the risk of poverty is co
nsiderably more pronounced amongst those 
whose land is not irrigated. According to estimates from 1999/00, approximately 42.1 percent 
of households without irrigation were poor (per 
capita consumption rank of less than 40 percent) 
as compared to 33.8 percent of household with
 irrigation. Among marginal landholders 45.4 
percent of households without access to irrigation were poor compared to a poverty incidence of 
39.3 percent among marginal landholders
 with access to irrigation.   
6.8 The rural poor are more likely to be reliant on agriculture as a source of income.  
Farming contributes to over 50 percent of rura
l income. The poorest households (those in the lowest income quintile) receive almost 78 pe
rcent of these income from cultivation and 
agricultural wage labor.  In fact, almost 52 per
cent of the income of the poorest households can 
be attributed to agricultural wage labor alone. 
As one moves from the lowest to highest income 
quintiles,  the contribution of agricultural wage 
income to total income decreases monotonically, 
while that of cultivation and non-farm sources in
creases monotically.  Wealthier rural households 
appear to have access to more assets (physical a
nd human capital) allowing them to participate in 
more remunerative non-farm employment activities. 
6.9 About one-fifth of the population in Tamil Na
du belongs to scheduled castes or tribes 
whose average standard of living is cons
iderably below the rest of the population.
  Eighty-
eight percent of SC/ST households owned less 
than 0.4 hectares of land in 1999/00. SC/ST 
households have a lower mean per capita consum
ption as well as lower levels of education as 
compared to non-SC/ST households. Scheduled cast
e and scheduled tribe population groups are 
highly represented in agricultural wage labor ac
tivities and  are particularly under-represented 
among cultivators and in regular non-farm employment.

  6.10 In both urban and rural areas, average consum
ption levels of households where the head 
had completed secondary education or higher are 
about twice as high as when the household head 
was illiterate. 
Labor Markets 6.11 Real wage rates in agriculture have risen steadily in the 1990s.
  The average annual increase in the real wage for male labor for harvesting increased from 2.8 percent per year during 
1986-92 to 7.2 percent per year during 1993-2001 (
Table  6.3).  During this latter period (1993-
2001), paddy and rice prices declined by an average 
of 2.0 percent per year in real terms due to 
increased productivity (yields) of paddy in Tamil Na
du, and in recent years, the declining cost of 
   63imported rice in neighboring states
.  Thus, the real wage in terms of paddy (rice) grew by an 
average of 9.8 percent per year from 1992/93 to 2000/01, again indicating increased purchasing 
power for rural laborers (
Figure  6.2).

   6.12 A declining rural labor force reflecting sign
ificant rural-urban migration, is one 
major factor behind the rise in real agricultural wages.  
According to the Population Census, 
total population in the state increased by 6.25 million people (11.2 percent)  between 1991 and 
2001.  In this period, urban 
population grew by 8.16 million people (42.8 percent); rural 
population actually declined by 1.91 million (5.2
 percent).  The rural population was thus 12.8 
percent less than it would have been if both the 
rural and urban populations
 increased by the same 
state-wide rate (11.2 percent).   6.13 For farmers that hire labor, however,
 increased labor costs imply reduced 
profitability.  Increases in labor costs have been partia
lly offset by increases in yields, thus 
limiting the decline in farmer paddy incomes.  More
over, higher costs of labor have encouraged 
mechanization, including the use of power tillers 
for land preparation and mechanical harvesters for paddy.  Nonetheless, higher labor costs are adversely affecting incomes of commercial 
farmers in Tamil Nadu, particularly in areas 
where urban and rural non-farm employment are 
   64increasing, such as the western zone (with its textile and other industries around Coimbatore) and 
in the northeast near Chennai.   Technological Change and  Rural Poverty 
 6.14 Despite concerns that the green revolution technology for rice (improved seeds, 
increased fertilizer use and irrigation) would 
lead to increased income inequality, most 
rural household groups benefited from increa
sed rice production in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Household surveys of farmers in North Ar
cot district (now Vellore and Thiruvannamalai 
[check]) indicated that, although the first adopters of the rice technology tended to be larger 
farmers, by the early 1980s small farmers in v
illages with access to irrigation had also adopted the new technologies at the same rate as large 
farmers (Hazell and Ramasamy, 1991).  Moreover, 
land distribution had remained essentially unch
anged, and agricultural wage earnings for 
agricultural laborers increased (though real 
agricultural wage rates did not increase). 
 6.15 Moreover, increased rice production led 
to substantial rural growth linkages, adding 
an additional 0.87 rupees of value added for ev
ery 1 rupee of value added from additional rice 
production.  One-half of these multiplier effects 
were due to increased demand for agricultural 
inputs, marketing and processing services; the 
remainder derived from increased consumer 
demands as household incomes rose. 

6.16 Survey results showed that real incomes of small paddy farmers and landless laborers 
rose by 90 and 125 percent, respectively, between 1973/74 to 1983/84.  Incomes of non-
agricultural households also rose by 55 percent, 
due in part to the growth linkage effects 
emanating from agricultural growth.  Real inco
me gains of large paddy farmers were only 18 
percent, due to increased costs of fertilizer and labor.  Notably, non-paddy with no access to 

irrigated land saw real income gains of only 17 percent. 
6.17 On an all-India scale, agricultural productivity growth from 1958-1994 played a 
major role in reducing poverty in India. 45  During this period, agricultural output per acre of 
net sown area grew by 2.91 percent per year, c
ontributing to higher real wages for agricultural 
laborers (which grew by 2.84 percent per year) and a decline in the real price of food.  (The price 
of food relative to agricultural laborers™ consumer price index fell by 0.15 percent per year from 
1976-94, after having increased by 0.62 percent per year from 1958-75.)  Higher farm yields for 
small producers also contributed directly to thei
r incomes, both directly through increased value 
of output and indirectly through increased employment.     
6.18 Whether future agricultural growth reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu reduces rural 
poverty will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new technologies and have 
access to markets, the magnitude of employmen
t and real wage rate gains, and the size of 
linkage effects with rural non-agriculture
.  Further reductions in the real price of food are not 
likely given the already low food prices (particularly in Tamil Nadu where the poor have access 
to subsidized rice through the PDS).  Land distribu
tion is unlikely to become more egalitarian and 
thus contribute to a redistribution of incomes, a
nd could even become more concentrated instead.   
6.19 Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor.

er efficiency of water use in the dry

Studies, No. 34, April 
   65season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops will 
be crucial, however.  Contract farming ma
y help overcome these problems, if competition 
between firms helps farmers maintain their shar
e of the value of the final product sales.   
6.20 The reduction in poverty is also likely to 
be greater if small farmers are able to 
participate in production and sales gains from off-season crops.
  New technologies like drip 
irrigation require substantial investments, and 
large farmers to adopt these technologies and shift 
to cultivation of higher value crops more quickly 
than small farmers.  Government programs to 
provide credit to small farmers were instrument
al in increasing adoption rates of rice technology in the 1970s and 1980s; the feasibility of similar 
targeted credit programs should be explored.   
      667. Conclusions and Policy Options 
 7.1 Traditional sources of agricultural growth
 in Tamil Nadu face major constraints
.  Seasonal water shortages, increasing land degradatio
n, continually shrinking farm sizes and rising 
costs of agricultural labor represent serious constrai
nts that need to be overcome if future growth 
in agriculture is to be realized. Further gains in rice production (a major engine of agricultural 
growth in the past four decades) will be hard to
 achieve, and may not be the most efficient use of 
resources in the context of national grain surpluses and the significant water requirements of rice 

cultivation.   7.2 Given the existing constraints, diversification into less water-intensive higher-value 
products, including fruits, vegetables, spices, and livestock products, is one of the most 
promising avenues for increasing agricultural growth. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions 
are well suited to diversified agriculture. Furthe
rmore, rapidly increasing incomes and changing 
food demand patterns provide strong impetus fo
r diversification. Increased agricultural 
diversification and private investments in processing for many of the higher valued agricultural 
commodities are likely to generate new rural no
n-farm employment opportunities and contribute 
to higher rural incomes.
   7.3 Overcoming the constraints faced by the 
agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu, and 
accelerating growth in agricultural production 
and the rate of rural poverty reduction, will 
require appropriate policies and inv
estments in four priority areas
: improving the efficiency 
of water use; increasing the effectiveness of public expenditures and agricultural extension; 
spurring the development of agricultural markets; 
and maximizing the real income growth of the 
rural poor. Increasing the Efficiency of Water Use 
7.4 Long-term growth in agriculture and rural incomes depends in large part on 
increasing the efficiency of use of water
.  7.5 Tamil Nadu has already taken some important
 steps in expenditure and organization 
reforms in irrigation and drainage institutions th
at are vital to improving the delivery of surface 
irrigation services and helping to ensure the longer-term performance of irrigation infrastructure.   
Further organizational reforms to streamline 
business processes to enhance efficiency and 
transparency and professionalize the work culture
 will be essential to improving service delivery 
to the client farmers, reduce costs of servi
ce provision (especially by modernizing and 
rightsizing), ensure financial sustainability of op
erations and maintenance of systems, and reduce 
the fiscal burden to state governments. 
7.6 More specifically, there are several options that Tamil Nadu could consider to manage its 
scarce water resources. These include: 
scaling up the pilot river-basin framework
 for managing water resources holistically, 
allowing interagency coordination and public-private 
partnerships; introducing specific legally enforceable 
water entitlements
 to various users in a river basin and or aquifer framework; 
changes in electricity, water and crop prices
 to change 
the financial incentives for irrigation and crop choice; 
improved management practices and 
irrigation technologies (such as drip and sprinkler irrigation) and 
new investments in canals and 
water storage (coupled with impr
oved operation and maintenance).
 7.7 Public administration in the water sector could be improved by separating the 
responsibilities for water resource management and irrigation service delivery
.  Tamil Nadu 
is the only state in India without a separate department of irrigation: administration of irrigation 
in the state is part of the Department of 
Public Works.  Two new agencies are needed: a 
   67regulatory agency to allocate the share of wate
r resources to agriculture, industry and other uses, 
and a irrigation department focusing on irrigation delivery systems.  A separate irrigation 
department would allow for the creation of a specia
lized cadre of irrigation specialists, instead of 
the current setup where staff from the Departme
nt of Public Works (which also includes administration of public buildings) are res
ponsible for delivering irrigation services.   
7.8 Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and 
WUAs are yet to be fully functional.  
There is a need to expedite the transfer of irrigation 
management to farmers in line with the FMIS 
Act so that water distribution would be more 
efficient and equitable.   7.9 The Government of Tamil Nadu recently a
nnounced increases in irrigation water 
charges and reintroduced a tariff for agricultural power consumers
. While these recent 
reforms are a step in the right direction, chargi
ng for water on a per area basis (as is the case for 
surface irrigation) or on a flat rate basis (for agricultural power consumers) is not efficient from 
an economic point of view as the marginal cost for water is almost zero and hence it does not 
affect the demand for irrigation water. 7.10  Irrigation water charges were revised  in July 2003
.  Previously, water charges were 
levied by the GoTN at a base rate (which va
ried according to crop, season, soil quality etc) 
coupled with an additional cess equivalent to six times the base rate.  This additional cess was transferred to the local panchayats.  Under the ne
w system of charges an additional water charge 
of Rs 150/ha de-linked from any additional cess ha
s been imposed.  Thus the farmer will pay the 
original charge plus the Rs 150/ha.  In add
ition, the FMIS Act empowers the water user™s 
associations (WUA) to charge users between  Rs 
250/ha to Rs 500/ha.  This additional charge can 
be retained by the WUA for operation and maintena
nce of the systems turned over to them. The 
current provisions for irrigation water charges woul
d be sufficient to allow full cost recovery of 
required O&M expenditures. The extent to which fa
rmers are actually being charged the proposed 
water rates remains unclear.  
 7.11 In 2002 an agricultural power tariff was introduced bringing an end to 12 years of 
free electricity for Tamil Nadu™s farmers.  
The revised agricultural power tariff included a flat rate for unmetered connections of Rs.250 per HP per annum and Rs.0.20/kWh for metered 
connections.  In conjunction with the reintr
oduction of the agricultural power tariff the 
government announced a pilot income support scheme 
for small and marginal farmers.  However, 
the reintroduction of the agriculture power tariff b
ecame a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu 
during the recent national election, and after a significant loss of seats in the national parliament, 
the TN government has reversed the policy.
 7.12 Other states also introduced tariffs in recent years (
Text Box  7.1).  International 
experience with income support programs also pr
ovides several important lessons for providing 
clear incentives and containing fiscal costs, including the need for targe
ting to poorer farmers 
(e.g., paying less per hectare as farm size increases, with a ceiling on the numbers of hectares 
eligible for payment), an effective delivery sy
stem for the transfer payments, and a limit on the 
number of years for which producers will be eligible for payments (
Table  7.1).

  7.13 Introduction of a flat rate charges of Rs 250/year for a 5 horsepower pumpset (a 
policy that has now been reversed) would have only
 a small effect on net returns to land and 
management, reducing them by only 4.9 to 
6.5 percent for major crops grown with well 
irrigation.  Costs of crop cultivation using well irrigation would rise by only 625 Rs/ha for most 
crops (the annual charge pro-rated for one season) to 1250 Rs/ha (for sugar cane grown over 
eleven months). 
However, if electricity charges are 
raised to the estimated marginal 
economic price of electricity to agriculture of 
3.1 Rs/Kwh, electricity costs rise to about 
4,600 Rs/ha for paddy and sugar
 cane, reducing returns to land and management by 35.9 
percent for rice and 23.8 percent for sugar cane
.  Likewise, total returns to land, labor and 
capital (value added) fall sharply for paddy and s
ugar cane irrigated by wells when the cost of 
electricity for pumping is included.  If electricity is costed at its economic price, total income 
generated from cotton cultivation 
(23,949 Rs/ha) is 53 percent greater than that for rice.  
Including the subsidy on fertilizer (through the Go
I), raises the total subsidy on rice and sugar 
cane cultivated with well irrigation to 41.1 and 40.3  
percent of net financial returns at the flat rate 
cost of electricity. 
7.14 Such large policy-induced reductions in returns for farmers are likely to be 
politically infeasible (as indicated by the re
cent election results), but gradual step towards 
marginal cost pricing of electricity, (perhaps 
combined with compensa
tion to farmers in the 
form of income transfers or a more reliable electricity supply), would help rationalize water 
use in Tamil Nadu
.  If their costs and incomes varied according to the amount of electricity (and 
water) used with well irrigation, farmers would 
have an incentive to shift some land from water-
intensive crops (rice and sugar cane) towards less
 water-intensive crops (including cotton, maize 
and vegetables). Greater attenti
on to marketing infrastructure, strengthening the research and 
extension to meet the needs of diversified agriculture, the development of tools for farmers to 
better manage risks, and improving irrigation pum
pset efficiency may create an environment 
within which higher power charges woul
d be more palatable for farmers. 
Andhra Pradesh. In 2003, Andhra Pradesh initiated a ﬁtatkalﬂ
 scheme under which farmers seeking immediate 
connection are required to pay Rs. 1/kWh to expedite the connection of the utilities.  
The current rate for farmers is Rs. 0.25
/kWh 
(full cost is Rs. 4/kWh).  Under this scheme, 30,000 new conn
ections were provided during th
e year by the utilities.  The 
government and the utilities are also separating the supply of pow
er to farmers from the other 
consumers, by splitting the 11kV
 rural 
feeders.  This initiative has several me
rits, including the potential to monitor the reliability and quality of power supply to
 farmers 
and an increase in cost recovery. However, investment 
cost is high at  Rs. 10 million for each 11kV feeder.   
Karnataka.
 The State Electricity Board in Karnataka recently
 initiated a program called ﬁOwn Your Transformer 
Scheme for Irrigation Pumpsets,ﬂ involving 
the drawing of 11 kV HT line under High Volta
ge Distribution System to the premise o
f pumpset consumers and providing them with small capacity transfor
mers.  The government is asking farmers to share equally the 
cost of the investment with the utilities, which is estimated 
at about Rs. 50 billion.  The scheme has the potential to reduce 
losses 
and improve the quality of supply. But the cost of the program 
is substantial. Given the cost sharing arrangement, it is likely
 that the 
scheme would benefit mostly large farmers.   As a means to 
target the subsidies, the Karnat
aka regulatory commission for the 
purpose of determining different tariffs has classified farmers acco
rding to the number of tubewells
 they own, and to the fact 
that 
they do not perceive income from ot
her activities such as
 civil servants. User associations. The Electricity Act, 2003, provides for the Uni
on Government to issue a National Policy permitting 
stand alone systems (including those based 
on renewable sources of energy and non-conventional sources of energy) for rural are
as, 
and a National Policy for rural electrification and for bulk purchas
e of power and management of local distribution in rural ar
eas through Panchayat Institutions, users™ associ
ations, co-operatives societies, non-Governmental organizations or franchisees.  T
hese institutional models have been piloted in I
ndia.  In terms of internal efficiency, 
some cooperatives are working well while oth
ers are 
not.  In cases where it did not work well, 
one major cause was the lack of penalties in
 defaulting in payments to the public el
ectric 
utility.  The institutional model potentially promising, provided 
there is the willingness to proceed with disconnections in ca
se of 
non-payments.

   707.15 Increases in electricity charges would h
ave only small effects on overall rice 
production and market prices, but major impl
ications for sugar cane production in the 
state.  Since only about 10 percent of rice area cultiv
ated is irrigated with well water (about 200 thousand hectares), changes in electricity pricing 
would have only marginal effects on total rice 
production in the state.  Moreover, since net pub
lic distribution (averaging 1.2 million tons per 
year from 1997/98-2001/02, 18 percent of net production) and private market trade from 
neighboring states (estimated at 1.0 Œ 1.3 million tons in the drought year 2002/03) are major 

sources of supply of rice, the effect of lower 
rice production from well water-irrigated areas on 
market prices of rice would likely be small.
 Impacts on sugar cane production would be much 
more significant, however, as essentially all of ar
ea is irrigated in part with well water.  
 7.16 Greater attention is also need for scaling-
up the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies and modernizing irrigation infrastructure
. While the use of sprinkler and drip 
technology has been promoted in the state, th
e high capital cost of these technologies currently 
poses a constraint to widespread adoption by marg
inal and small farmers and greater attention to 
development of more affordable technologies is 
warranted or a suitable system of targeted 
subsidies should be developed to scale-up the use of sprinkler and drip systems. 
7.17 Improving the productivity of rainfed agriculture will require new investments and 
increased emphasis on
 community participation with sound technical inputs
 to improve the 
success of watershed programs.
 A basin perspective should be adopted in implementation of 
all watershed programs
 to ensure that these initiatives do not have negative impacts on 
downstream human and ecological uses
. Increasing the Effectiveness of Public Ex
penditures and Agricultural Extension  7.18 A highly effective research and agricultural ex
tension system is needed to respond to 
the needs of diversified agriculture.  An assessment of the state™s comparative advantage in 
producing higher value crops for the domestic a
nd export markets would also help in setting 
future research and development priorities.  Re
-orienting agricultural research to make it more 
farmer-responsive would likewise improve the outpu
t of a system that has enjoyed much success 
in rice technology development in the past. Simila
rly, the current extension system in the state 
remains organized around a modified Training and Visit approach and continues to be highly 
focused on major food-grains, though the promotion of
 public-private partnerships in extension is 
a very encouraging recent  development and offe
rs potential for both cost-savings and greater 
efficiency (
Figure  7.1).  Thus, it is recommended that the GoTN develop a new agricultural 
extension strategy to meet the changing needs 
of farmers. This could include adopting an 
integrated and decentralized extension system th
at could help build farmer organizations that 
could link with private firms to increase economic growth in rural areas.   
7.19 Rationalizing public expenditures and shi
fting expenditures from subsidies to 
investments in key public goods such rural 
roads, markets and agricultural research and 
extension will facilitate productivity improve
ments and diversification of agriculture to higher value products
. Tightening competition for limited fiscal resources heightens the urgency 
of appropriate public expenditure reallocati
on. Institutional reforms within government 
departments to ensure improved quality of deliver
y of rural-related public goods and services is 
also important.

   Promoting the Development of Well Functioning Agricultural Markets  7.20 Well functioning agricultural markets are al
so important for successful agricultural 
diversification. If recent policy reforms removing restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking 
and sales of paddy and 13 other crops are consisten
tly implemented at the local level, they can be 
expected to improve marketing efficiency
, reducing the margin between producer and 
consumer/export prices. Reductions in marketing 
costs are also necessary in order for production 
increases to lead to higher agricu
ltural incomes, particularly for perishable high-value products 
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, animal products). Contr
act farming and other private sector initiatives 
should be encouraged, though the impact of
 these business arrangements on farmer incomes 
should be evaluated, as well (
Text Box  7.2).  
7.21 There remain, however, important roles for the public sector in promoting agro-
food system and agro-enterprise development (
Text Box  7.3
).  In addition to policies that 
establish ﬁrules of the gameﬂ and address market fa
ilures, public investments in rural roads to 
strengthen rural connectivity can contribute to re
duced costs of marketing.  Although Tamil Nadu 
has an extensive road network, further attention 
to maintenance and upgrading of rural roads in 
some regions may be warranted.  
Given the rapidly changing nature of markets in Tamil Nadu, an 
in-depth study of market structure and 
investment needs would be useful.   
7.22 Increasing agricultural diversification will not compromise Tamil Nadu™s food 
security objectives given an effective PDS, we
ll-functioning markets and targeted nutrition programs
.  Greater food security has largely been 
achieved through increases in state production of major staples (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice through the PDS, school feeding 
programs, and targeted relief programs during droughts. During the recent drought of  2002/03 
the wholesale prices of rice only rose 2.8 percent (in real terms) above the previous year™s price, 

despite a 34 percent fall in paddy production in th
e state, helping to maintain access to food for 
poor consumers. This was largely due to privat
e sector inflows from neighboring states of Andhra 
Pradesh and Karnataka and the ava
ilability of rice through the PDS.

   72 Text Box  7.2:  Contract Farming in Punjab 
 Maximizing Real Income Growth for the Poor 
 7.23 Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor
.  Increased availability of water and great
er efficiency of water use in the dry 
season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops 
remains an important unresolved issue, however.  Contract farming may help overcome these 
problems, if competition between firms helps farmers 
maintain their share of the value of the final 
product sales.  The experience of Latin America 
and the Caribbean suggests that education, 
transport infrastructure, and engines of non-farm
 growth that promote female employment are 
key aspects of a success strategy
 to promote non-farm growth 
and rural poverty reduction (Box 
7.4). 7.24 Whether agricultural diversification reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new 
technologies and have access to markets, the 
magnitude of employment and real wage rate gains, and the size of linkage effects with 
rural non-agriculture. An assessment of the implications
 for rural poverty reduction of an 
agricultural diversification strategy involving cap
ital-intensive technologies (e.g. drip irrigation) 
and higher-risk crops is needed. . This assessment
 should include a review of crop and  drought 
insurance instruments and the potential for innova
tions in these instruments to enable rural 
households, particularly the poor, to better ma
nage the new and existing risks they face. 
 Contract farming
 is production and marketing arrange
ment between farmers and processi
ng and/or marketing firms for the 
production and supply of agricultural products under forward agreemen
ts, frequently at pre-determined prices.  In Punjab, the 
state government has assigned the task of pr
omoting contract farming in the state to 
the Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation 
(PAFC), for which it has developed a five-year plan that aims 
to shift one million hectares out
 of rice-wheat cultivation to a 
variety of other crops.  PAFC sees its approach to be that 
of a facilitator, tying up farmers with agribusinesses which will 
supply quality seeds and technical assistance,
 and buy back the crop.  Various models
 are being tried out, but it is still too 
early to judge their effectiveness.   
 
Punjab agriculture appears to be well-suite
d for contract farming in terms of its 
physical and social environment Œ highly 
productive agriculture with assured irrigation, widespread
 mechanization, all villages connected by roads, good 
telecommunications, and average farm size more than twice the 
India average.  Moreover, PAFC™s venture into this field 
embodies a more market-oriented approach 
to agricultural development and a significan
t shift away from the state™s traditional 
focus on production as an end in itself.   

 
International experience suggests that cont
ract farming tends to succeed only in cer
tain types of crops/activities such as 
perishable products, or those where exacting market specifications 
have to be met.  Basic field crops like standard rice, wheat
, maize, oilseeds, pulses do not normally figur
e highly in contract farmi
ng programs and there is also a high risk of ‚side selli
ng™ i.e., farmer will sell output to another buyer.    
 The absence of a quick and effective contract enforcement and 
dispute resolution system in Punjab (and India) magnifies the 
risk of farmers ‚side selling™ if market prices at time of ha
rvest significantly exceed the contr
acted price, or conversely the
 risk 
of buyer default if market prices are we
ll below the contract price.  To address 
this, the state government needs to facilitate
 initiatives by agribusiness and fa
rmers organizations wishing to 
develop speedy dispute-resolution systems.  This might lead to
 a system for registration of contracts.  
The government™s role should generally be li
mited to that of a facilitator, however, s
ince 
to be successful, dispute-resolutions syst
ems are best designed by the interested 
parties.  Likewise, direct commercial 
involvement of the state should be minimal.  In some of the 
models being adopted this is not the case as PAFC is exposing 
itself to a high degree of risk by contracting to 
buy output from farmers in case the buyer backs out.

 The experience of Latin America and the Ca
ribbean in promoting the growth of the rural non-farm economy suggests some basic 
policy principles:   Agricultural policies can promote non-farm activities 
such as agro-processing and the other industrial, 
commercial and service sectors that characterize modern
 agriculture.  Agricultural 
policies in areas such as 
technology generation and diffus
ion, infrastructure, education, agrarian 
reform, credit, etc., should therefore be 
designed and developed with
 these links in mind. 
 Projects and policies aimed at promoting the rural non-
farm economy should not just focus on improving the 
capacity of households to become involved in the non farm
 economy, but should also st
imulate the engines that 
pull rural households into it.  Touris
m and manufacturing are examples of su
ch engines that are not traditionally viewed as part of the rural landscape.  Engines of
 non-farm growth that offer employment to women in 
particular, should be emphasized. 
 Local governments and institutional participation will need
 to be engaged in a whole variety of capacities, 
ranging from land use planning, educ
ation provision, infrastructure inve
stment, regulations, training, and 
financing. 
 Efforts must be directed to ensu
ring public institutions with responsibilities relating to non-farm activities 
(education, public works, small-scale industry, etc.) c
oordinate efforts and long beyond traditional competencies 
to include the non-farm economy.  Education and transport 
infrastructure in particul
ar, must receive concerted 
attention.  Richer and poorer zones must be treated differently, wi
th less emphasis in richer 
zones on subsidization and more on reducing transactions costs.  In poorer zones,
 public interventions to provide the basic enabling 
environment will continue to be required.

1. INTRODUCTION
 
AND BACKGROUND
 
 
Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the Indian economy. Although its contribution to gross 
domestic product (GDP) is now around one sixth, it provides e
mployment to 56 per cent of the 
Indian workforce. Also, the forward and backward linkage effects of agriculture growth increase 
the incomes in the non
-
agriculture sector. The growth of some commercial crops has significant 
potential for promoting exports o
f agricultural commodities and bringing about faster 
development of agro
-
based industries. Thus agriculture not only contributes to overall growth of 
the economy but also reduces poverty by providing employment and food security to the 
majority of the popu
lation in the country and thus it is the most inclusive growth sectors of the 
Indian economy.
 
The 12
th
 
Five Year Plan Approach Paper also indicates that agricultural 
development is an important component of faster, more inclusive sustainable growth approac
h. 
 
 
The structural reforms and stabilization policies introduced in India in 1991 initially focused on 
industry, tax reforms, foreign trade and investment, banking and capital markets. 
The economic 
reforms did not include any specific package specifically
 
designed for agriculture
. 
In the post
-
reform (since 1991) period, India has done well in some indicators such as economic growth, 
exports, balance of payments, resilience to externa
l shocks, service sector growth, 
significant 
accumulation of foreign excha
nge, Information technology (IT) and stock market, improvements 
in telecommunications etc
. 
GDP growth was around 8 to 9% per annum in the period 2004
-
05 to 
2007
-
08. India is 
now 2
 
trillion dollar economy. Investment and savings rates were quite high 32 
to 
36%.
 
 
However, 
there have been exclusion problems in the country. 
In other words, real development 
in terms of growth shared by all sections of the population has not taken place. We have 
problems of poverty, unemployment, inequalities in access to health 
and education and poor 
per
formance of agriculture sector.
 
One of the excluded sector during the reform period was 

concerns on the performance of agriculture secto
r in the country. The post
-
reform growth was 
led by services. Commodity sector growth (agriculture+industry) has not been higher in the post
-
reform period as compared to that of 1980s. Particular worry is agriculture sector which showed 
lower than 2% per a
nnum
 
in the decade of mid
-
1990s to mid
-
2000s
.
 
There are also concerns on 
food security and livelihoods.
 
 
 
Small holdings agriculture which is the focus of this paper is important for raising agriculture 
growth, food security and livelihoods
 
in India
. 
It ma
y be noted that Indian agriculture
 
is the 
home of small 
and marginal 
farmers (80%).
 
Therefore, the future of sustainable agriculture 
growth and food security in India depends on the performance of small and marginal farmers
.

Agricult
ural Census data shows 
that there
 
were about 121 million agricultural holdings in India 
in 2000
-
01.  Around 99 million were small and marginal  farmers.
 
 
Average size has declined 
from 2.3 ha. In 1970
-
71 to 1.37 ha. In 2000
-
01
. 
Small and marginal farmers account for more 
than 80
% of total farm hhs. But their share in operated area is around 44%. 
Thus, there are
 
significant land inequalities
 
in India.
 
 
 
The role of small farms in development and poverty reduction is well recognized (Lipton, 2006). 
The global experience of growth a
nd poverty reduction
 
shows that GDP growth originating in 
agriculture
 
is at least twice as eff
ective in reducing poverty as
 
GDP growth originating outside 
agriculture
 
(WDR, 2008). 
Small holdin
gs play important role in raisi
ng agricultural development 
and p
overty reduction.
 
 
The objective of this paper is to examine the role and challenges of small holding agricult
ure
 
in 
achieving agricultural growth, 
food security and livelihoods in India. The paper also shows that 
market oriented reforms are not sufficient
 
and government intervention and other support are 
needed for small holdings to achieve the 
above 
goals
. It is known that
 
small farmers 
face 
several 
challenges in the access to inputs
 
and marketing
.
 
They need a level playing field with large farms 
in terms
 
of accessing land, water, inputs, credit, technology and markets. 
 
 
Small holdings also face new challenges on integration of value chains, liberalization and 
globalization effects, market volatility and other risks and vulnerability, adaptation of climat

There are

The paper is
 
organized as follows. Section 3 gives a brief background on agricultural growth and 
policies on agriculture. Section 3 
 
examines the roles and challenges of small
 
holding agriculture 
in India. It covers trends in agricultural growth, cultivation patterns, participation of small 
holding agriculture, productivity performance of small holders, linking small holders with 
markets, 
role of small holders in enhancing food
 
security and employment generation, 
differential policies and institutional support for small holders and, challenges and future options 
for small holding agriculture includ
ing information needs. Section 4
 
provides lessons from the 
experience of India on 
small holding agriculture for other countries.
 
 
2. BACKGROUND
 
 
One of the paradoxes of the Indian economy is that the decline in the share of agricultural 
workers in total workers has been slower than the decline in the share of agriculture in the GDP. 
For
 
example, the share of agriculture and allied activities in the GDP declined from 57.7 per cent 
in 1950

1 to 15.7 per cent in 2008

9 (Table 1). The share of agriculture in total workers, 
however, declined slowly from 75.9 per cent in 1961 to 56.4 per cent 
in 2004
-
05 (Table 1).
 
 
 
3
 
 
 
Between 1961 and 2004
-
05, there was a decline of 34 percentage points in the share of 
agriculture in GDP while the decline in share of agriculture in employment was of only 19.5 
percentage points. As a result, the gap between labou
r productivity in agriculture and non
-
agriculture increased rapidly.
 
 
In terms of growth, the performance of agriculture in the post
-
Independence era has been 
impressive as compared to the pre
-
Independence period. The all crop output growth of around 
2.57 
per cent per annum in the post
-
Independence period (during 1949

50 to 2007
-
8) was much 
higher than the negligible growth rate of around 0.4 per cent per annum in the first half of the last 
century. As a result, India achieved significant gains in food grai
ns and non
-
food grain crops. 
 
 
The highest growth rate of GDP from agriculture and allied activities of 3.9 per cent per annum 
in recent years was recorded in the period 1992
-
3 to 1996
-
71 (Table 2). If we look at decadal 
average 1980s recorded the highest 
growth rate of more than 3 per cent per annum. In the post
-
reform period, it declined to 2.76 per cent per annum. The deceleration in the growth rate of 
GDP from agriculture between the first half of the 1990s and the later period is glaring. It is 
disquie
ting to note that during the 1997

8 to 2004

5, agriculture growth was only 1.6 per cent 
per annum (Table 2). Fortunately, it recorded growth of 3.5 per cent per annum during 2004
-
05 
to 2010
-
11. 
12
th
 
Five Year Plan (20012
-
17) aims to achieve 4% growth in ag
riculture.
 
Significant fluctuation in growth of agriculture is a matter of concern
 
(Fig1)
. 
 
 
Extensive cultivation has characterized Indian agriculture during the pre
-
1965 era, and intensive 
cultivation in the post
-
green revolution period. There has been s
ignificant increase in the use of 
modern inputs in Indian agriculture. During the period 1950

1 to 2003

4, the percentage of net 
irrigated area to net cultivated area increased from around 17 to 41. During the same period, 
fertilizer consumption showed a s
ignificant rise from less than 1 kg/ha to 90 kg/ha. Similarly, the 
percentage of area under high yielding varieties (HYVs) to cereals cropped area has risen from 
15 in 1970

1 to 75 in the late 1990s. The share of agriculture in electricity consumption also
 
rose 
from 4 per cent in 1950

1 to nearly 30 per cent in recent years. All this led to a significant 
increase in agricultural output over time. 
 
 
It may be noted
 

central go
vernment plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural policies. Although Indian
 
agriculture is in private hands, government policies have greatly influenced its pace and 
character.
 
 
Broadly, agricultural development policies over time can be divided into f
our sets of policy 
packages: (a) institutional reforms; (b) public investment policies; (c) incentive policies; and (d) 
reforms and globalization policies. The relative importance of the first three sets has varied over 
time. 
 
 
Thus, during the first three
 
Five Year Plans (1950

65), the institutional reforms and public 
investment packages dominated. The central and state governments enacted a number of laws 
regarding land reforms. These laws mainly relate to three aspects: abolition of zamindari system, 
lan
d ceiling and redistribution of land, and tenancy reforms. The government was successful in 
abolishing the zamindari or intermediary system after paying compensation to the zamindars. 
4
 
 
The land ceiling laws were not effective although there was redistributi
on of some land to the 
beneficiaries. The tenancy reforms were more successful in two states, West Bengal in the east 
and Kerala in the south, than in others. West Bengal succeeded in giving ownership rights to 
tenants, particularly sharecroppers (
bargarda
r
s). Some efforts were made to consolidate 
fragmented holdings in India since Independence. In some parts of north and north
-
west India 
these efforts were relatively successful. 
 
 
There was significant public investment in agriculture during 1950

65. To ac
hieve the objective 
of self
-
sufficiency in food grains, there was massive investment particularly in constructing 
irrigation reservoirs and distribution systems. Another important policy during this period was 
the expansion of institutional credit which he
lped reduce informal sources that had been 
exploitative in respect of interest rates and terms and conditions. 
 
 
During the 1967

90 period, incentive policies for adoption of new technology and public 
investment policies dominated government strategy in ag
riculture. After the humiliating 
experience with import of food grains in the mid
-
1960s, there was a vigorous drive for achieving 
self
-
sufficiency in food grains by stepping up public investment in irrigation and introduction of 
new technology through ince
ntives. There was a need to increase domestic food production at a 
faster rate by much higher productivity without upsetting the agrarian structure. Luckily at that 
time new high
-
yielding dwarf varieties of wheat and rice were available in Mexico and the 
P
hilippines respectively. Yields increased significantly for wheat initially and later for rice. This 

associated with the green revolution is best described as forest
-
 
o
r land
-
saving agriculture. It may 
be noted that without the green revolution it would not have been possible to lift the production 
potential of Indian agriculture.
 
 
 
Incentive policies focused on both inputs and output. Subsidies for inputs like irrigatio
n, credit, 
fertilizers, and power increased significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. The objective of the 
subsidies is to provide inputs at low prices to protect farmer interests and encourage diffusion of 
new technology. Similarly, on the output side, there 
has been a comprehensive long
-
term 
procurement
-
cum
-
distribution policy in the post
-
green revolution period. The government 
announces the support prices at sowing time and agrees to buy all the grains offered for sale at 
this price. To support these operati
ons, institutions like the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and 
the Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) were established in the mid
-
1960s. 
 
 
In the post
-
reform period, economic reforms in India since 1991 have improved the incentive 
framework and agricultu
re has benefited from reduction in protection to industry. The terms of 
trade for agriculture have improved and private investment has increased. Export of 
commodities, particularly cereals, has risen and there has been some progress on market reforms 
in t
erms of removing domestic and external controls. However, there were also concerns about 
agriculture and food security in the 1990s. There has been emphasis on price factors at the cost 
of non
-
price factors like research and extension, irrigation, and cred
it. Economic reforms have 
largely neglected the agricultural sector and only in the last few years have domestic and external 
trade reforms in the sector started. 
 
 
5
 
 
Trade policies in India during the last five decades have been highly interventionist and 
d
iscriminating against agriculture. There has been pessimism regarding international trade in 
agriculture. 
 
 
Trade liberalization in agriculture has been faster towards the end of the 1990s in tune with WTO 
agreements. There has been considerable progress i
n the liberalization of export controls, and 
quantitative controls on imports and on decontrol of domestic trade. 
The 11
th
 
Five Year Plan 

th
 
Plan is its target of 
4 per cent per annum growth in GDP from agriculture and allied sectors. A 
detailed agenda for action is spelt out in Mid
-
term appraisl of 11
th
 
Five Year Plan
 
covering 
improved access to water, improvement in the supply of good quality seeds, replenishment 
of 
soil nutrients, improvements in agricultural research and extension, reforms in land tenancy and 
improvements in agricultural marketing which is particularly important for perishable produce. 
The 12
th
 
Five Year Plan is going to focus on small and margin
al farmers and resource poor 
regions.

ROLES
,
 
CHALLENGES 
AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR
 
SMALL HOLDING 
AGRICULTURE IN INDIA
 
In this section, we examine the role, challenges, policies and opportunities for small holding 
agriculture in India. 
India is a big countr

closer to that of Europe. Therefore, there is also a need to look at regional level to bring out the 
variations.
 
 
3.1. Role of Small Holding Agriculture
 
 
Structure of land holdings
: 
India is a land o
f small farmers. According to
 
Agricultural Census 
2000
-
01, there were an estimated 98
 
milli
on small and marginal holdings out of around 120 
million total land
 
households in 
the country. As shown in Table 3
, the share of marginal and 
small farmers accounted
 
for around 81% of operational holdings 
in 2002
-
03 
as compared to 
about 62% in 1960
-
61. Similarly, the area operated by small and marginal farmers has increased 
from about 19% to 44% during the same period. 
Recent data for 2005
-
06 shows that the share of 
s
mall and marginal farmers 
in land holdings 
was 83%
 
(Chand et al, 2011)
. 
Thus, the small 
holding character of Indian agriculture is much more prominent today than even before.
 
The average size of holdings in India declined from
 
2.3 ha. in 1970
-
71 to 1.33
 
ha
. in 2000
-
01.
 
It 
may be noted that 63% of land holdings belong to marginal farmers with less than 1 ha. The 
average size of marginal holdings 
is only 0.24 at all India level. 
The average size of small 
holdings is 1.42 ha. 
Table 4
 
shows average size of hold
ings by farm size. The average size of 
marginal holdings varies from 0.14 ha. in Kerala to 0.63 ha. in Punjab. 
  
 
 
Access to
 
Irrigation
: 
The access to irrigation has increased for all categories of farmers. 
It 
is the 
highest for marginal farmers followed b
y small farmers. 
Table 5
 
indicates that the percentage of 
area under irrigation for small farmers increased from 40 in 1980
-
81 to 51 in 2000
-
01. 
On the 
other hand, for large farmers it rose from 16 to 31% during the same period. It may, however, be 
noted t
hat large farmers capitalize on cheaper sources like canals while small farmers have to 
rent water. About 40 per cent of the irrigated are for large farmers was from canals while it was 
less than 25 per cent in the case of small and marginal farmers (NCEUS
, 2008). 
 
 
6
 
 
Access to Fertilizers
 
and Area under HYV
: 
The fertilizer per hectare is inversely related to farm 
size for both irrigated and unirrigated areas (
Table 6
). It increased from marginal farmers in 
irrigated areas from 100 kgs. in 1980
-
81 to 252 kgs.
 
in 2001
-
02. In fact, the per hectare 
consumption for all farm sizes was similar on irrigated areas in 1981
-
82 but it rose faster for 
marginal farmers and small farmers in 2001
-
02. 
This is true in the case of unirrigated areas also.
 
 
Similarly, the percent
age of area under high yielding varieties (HYV) is also inversely related to 
farm size (Table 7). In the irrigated areas, the coverage of are under HYV was 89%, 86% and 
78% respectively in marginal, small and large farmers in 2001
-
02. In the case of unirri
gated 
areas, the coverage was above 50% for marginal, small and semi
-
medium but it was only 30% 
for large farmers in 2001
-
02.
 
 
 
Cropping Intensity
:
 
Multiple cropping index is higher for marginal and small farmers than that 
for medium and large farmers. For
 
marginal farmers, cropping intensity increased from 134 in 
1981
-
82 to 139 in 2001
-
02 (Table 8). In the case of large farmer, it rose from 116 to 121 during 
the same period. The differences across farm sizes persisted over time.
 
 
Cropping Patterns
: 
Do 
smal
l 
and marginal 
farmers 
grow high value crops? Table 
9
 
shows 
cropping patterns by size of farms. Birthal et al (2011) provide four conclusions from these 
cropping patterns: (a) small and marginal farmers allocate larger proportion of their cultivated 
land t
o high value crops like fruits, and vegetables ; (b) small and marginal farmers seem to have 
comparative advantage in growing vegetables than fruits because of quick returns in the former; 
(c) small and marginal farmers allocate larger proportion of rice a
nd wheat than other farmers; 
(d) small and marginal farmers allocate lower proportion of land to pulses and oilseeds.   
 
 
Farm Size, output and productivity
:
 
The contribution to output is higher for marginal and small 
farmers as compared to their share in 
area. The share of these farmers was 46.1% in land 
possessed but they contribute 51.2% to the total output of the country (Fig 2 and Table 10) at all 
India level in 2002
-
03. There are significant regional variation
s
 
in their contribution to output. 
The sha
re of output is less than the operated area in ten states (Table 10). In rest of the states, the 
reverse was true. The contribution of small and marginal farmers to output ranges from 19% in 
Punjab to 86% in West Bengal. It is less than 50% in 9 out of 20 
states. In the Estern states, the 
share of both area and output are high for these farmers. On the other hand, in some of the states 
in Central, Western and North
-
Western regions, medium and large farmers still dominate in both 
area and output.
 
 
In terms o
f production, small and marginal farmers also make larger contribution to the 
production of high value crops. They contribute around 70% to the total production of 
vegetables, 55% to fruits against their share of 44% in land area (Birthal, 2011). Their sha
re in 
cereal production is 52% and 69% in milk production. 
Thus, small farmers contribute to both 
diversification and food security.
 
Only in the cases of pulses and oilseeds, their share is lower 
than other farmers.  
 
 
There has been debate in India on the
 
relationship between farm size and productivity. The 

produce more in value terms per hectare than the medium and large farms. Fig 3 show
s
 
that 
value of output 
per hectare was Rs.14754 for marginal farm
ers, Rs.13001 for small farmers, Rs. 
7
 
 
10655 for medium farmers and Rs.8783 for large farmers. 
It shows that from efficiency point 
of view, small holdings are equal or better than large holdings.
 
Table 11 indicates l
arge 
regional variations in the value of output per hectare. For marginal farmers, it varies from 
Rs.29448 in Punjab to Rs.7177 in Rajasthan. This is also true for large medium and large farmers 

 
it ranges from Rs.28983 in Punjab to Rs.4213 in Rajasthan. 
In many states, small holdings 
have higher value of output per hectare than large farms. However, in the case of states like, 
Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the large farms 
have higher productivity (in value terms) 
than marginal farmers. In the case of Punjab, the 
differences in productivity are not large across farm sizes.
 
 
 
3.2. Small Holders and Livelihoods
 
We have mentioned above that 98 million out of total 120 million farm holdings are small and 
marginal farmer
s. The sustainability of these farmers is crucial for livelihoods in rural areas and 
for the entire country. It is true that small holdings have higher productivity than medium and 
large farms. But, as our discussion below shows that it is not enough to co
mpensate for the 
disadvantage of 
the small area of holdings. The cost of cultivation per hectare is also high on 
small and marginal farmers than medium and large farms (Table 12). At the all India level, net 
farm income per hectare for small holdings is hi
gher than large holdings (Table 13).
 
The data at 
state level shows that in 9 out of 20 states, the reverse is true 

 
net farm income per hectare is in 
large holdings higher than small holdings
2
.
 
 
However, the monthly income and consumption figures across d
ifferent size class of land 
holdings show that marginal and small farmers have dis
-
savings compared to medium and large 
farmers. 
The average monthly income of farmer households is comprised of income from wages, 
net receipts from cultivation, net receipts 
from farming of animals and income from non
-
farm 
business. The average monthly consumption of farmer households is comprised of total food and 
non
-
food expenditure. 
 
 
According to NSS 
2003 data, the monthly consumption of marginal farmers was Rs.2482 and 
m
onthly income was Rs.1659
 
(Table 14 and Fig 4.1)
. It shows that they have 
dis
-
savings of 
Rs.823. The dis
-
savings for small farmers were Rs.655. On the other hand, for large farmers, 
monthly income and consumption respectively were Rs.9667 and Rs.6418 with 
savings of 
Rs.3249. Table 14 and Figs 4.2 to 4.7 provide
s
 
state wise details on monthly income and 
consumption according to farm size. 

consumption expenditure of 
marginal and small farmers exceeds their estimated income by a substanti
al margin and 
presumably the deficits have to be plugged by borrowing or other means

 
(p.12). NCEUS (2008) 
also indicates that the poverty for small holding farmers is much higher than other farmers. The 
need for increase in productivity and incomes of sma
ll holdings and promotion of non
-
farm 
activities for these farmers are obvious. 
 
 
 
3.3. Issues and Challenges for Small Holders
 
There are many issues and challenges for small holding agriculture in India. 

survey of 2003 brought out many issues
 
relating to small and marginal farmers. Based on this 

-
small 
farmers as agriculturalists are: imperfect markets for inputs/product leading to smaller value

tices and

section discusses som
e of the key issues and challenges 
relating to small holding agriculture.
 
 
 
Role of women
:
 
The importance of women in agriculture has been increasing. 
The share of rural 
females in agriculture was around 83 per cent in 2004
-
05 as compared to 67% among rura
l men, 
showing the importance of women in agriculture in rural areas.
 
Percentage of women among 
marginal farmers (38.7%) is higher than that for large farmers (34.5%) in 2004
-
05. These 
proportions have increased over time. 
Agriculture is becoming increasin
gly feminized as men are 
migrating to rural non
-
farm sector. 
They work in 

land preparation, seed selection and seed 
production, sowing, in applying manure, fertilizer and pesticides, weeding, transplanting, 
threshing, winnowing and harvesting etc as well 
as in animal husbandry and dairying, fish 
processing, collection of non timber forest produces (NTFPs), back yard poultry, and collection 
of fuel wood, fodder and other products for family needs

.
 
Despite 
their
 
importance, 
women are continually
 
denied their
 
property rights and access to other productive resources. 
Protecting
 

giving legal s
upport on existing laws, will facilitate
 
recognition for women as farmers and en
able 
them to access credit, inputs, and marketing outlets.
   
 
 
Social Groups
:
 
The proportion of socially disadvantaged groups such as Scheduled Castes (SCs) 
and Scheduled Tribes (STs) is higher among marginal and small farmers than that of medium 
and large
 
farmers. Around 22% of semi
-
marginal and marginal farmers are from SCs compared 
to 7.8% in medium and large farmers. SCs have more than half of their holdings of less than half 
a hectare. Similarly, 15.6% of small farmers belong to STs compared to 14.9% a
mong medium 
and large farmers. The distribution of land ownership among STs is better
 
than SCs. However, 
the quality of STs land is probably of the lowest quality. Social identity of farmers is also seen to 
mediate access to economic resources and outcomes
. Even after accounting for quantity and 
quality of land owned by socially deprived classes, their access to information, marketing, credit 
and publicly provided inputs and extension services are lower. This shows that they possibly 
suffer from discriminat
ion in the delivery of public services as well as market (NCEUS, 2008).
 
 
 
 
Land Issues: Land and tenancy security
:
 
National Commission on Enterprises for Unorganized 
Sector
 
argued that there
 
is a strong evidence that relatively successful implementation of
 
even  a 
modest package of land reforms dramatically improve the prospect of the poor. Regaing small 
and marginal farmers, they own and cultivate some land
 
but it is a limiting factor for getting 
resources. Therefore, tenancy security is important for smal
l holding farmers.
 
 
Land relations are extremely complicated and this complexity has contributed significantly to the 
problems facing actual cultivators. Unregistered cultivators, tenants, and tribal cultivators all face 
difficulties in accessing instituti
onal credit and other facilities available to farmers with land 
titles. One priority is to record and register actual cultivators including tenants and women 
cultivators, and provide passbooks to them, to ensure that they gain access to institutional credi
t 
and other inputs. As part of the reforms, lease market should be freed and some sort of security 
9
 
 
for tenants has to be guaranteed. This will ensure availability of land for cultivation on marginal 
and small farmers. The land rights of tribals in the agen
cy areas must be protected. There is 
considerable scope for further land redistribution, particularly when  waste and cultivable lands 
are taken into account. Complementary inputs for cultivation (initial land development, input 
minikits, credit, etc.) sho
uld be provided to all assignees, and the future assignments of land 
should be in the name of women.
 
 
 

farmers should be assisted to buy land through the provision of in
stitutional credit, on a long 
term basis, at a low rate of interest and by reducing stamp duty. At the same time, they should be 
enabled to enlarge their operational holdings by liberalizing the land lease market. The two 
major elements of such a reform ar
e: security of tenure for tenants during the period of contract; 

Commission, 2007a). Basically, we have to ensure land leasing, create conditions including 
credi
t, whereby the poor can access land from those who wish to leave agriculture. 
 
 
Low level of formal education and skills
: 
Education and skills are important for improving 
farming practices, investment and productivity. Table 
15 gives literacy levels and me
an years of 
education for unorganized self employed agriculture workers by farm size. It shows that literacy 
and mean years of education are lower for small holding farmers compared to medium and large 
farmers. For example, literacy among males and females
 
for marginal farmers respectively were 
62.5% and 31.2% while the corresponding numbers for medium and large farmers were 72.9% 
and 39% (Table 15). Similarly, mean years of education for males among marginal farmers was 
3.9  as compared to 5.3  for medium 
and large farmers. It is important for small holding farmers 
to have a reasonable level of awareness regarding information on agricultur
e. The low level of 

shows t
hat awareness about bio
-
fertilizers, minimum support prices and WTO is associated with 
education levels which are lower for marginal and small farmers.
 
 
 
Credit and Indebtedness
:
 
Small holdings need credit for both consumption and investment 
purposes. Incr
easing indebtedness is one of the reasons for indebtedness among these farmers in 
recent years. Table
 
16 shows that overall indebtedness is not higher for small and marginal 
farmers compared to large farmers. However, the indebtedness for the small & margi
nal farmers 
from formal institutional sources is lower than large farmers and the reverse is true in the case of 
informal sources. The dependence on money lenders is the highest for sub
-
marginal and 
marginal farmers
 
(Table 17)
. 
Table 18 
shows that the shar
e of formal source increases with the 
size of land. At all India level, the share of formal source varies from 22.6% to 58% for small 
and marginal farmers while it varies from 65 to 68% for medium to large farmers. Dependence 
of small and marginal farmers 
on informal sources is high even in states like Andhra Pradesh, 
Punjab and Tamil Nadu. For example, small and marginal farmers of Andhra Pradesh have to 
depend on 73% to 83% of their loans on informal sources. This indicates very low financial 
inclusion fo
r Andhra Pradesh. The NSS data also shows that across social groups, the 
indebtedness through formal sources is lower for STs as compared to others.  
 
 
 
Globalization challenges
: 
Increasing globalization has
 
added to the problems faced by the small 
holding
 
agriculture. The policies of huge subsidies and protection policies by developed 
countries have negative effects on small holding farmers in developing countries. If support is 
10
 
 
not given to small farms, globalization may become advantageous for large farm
s.
There has been 
adverse impact of  trade liberalization on the agricultural economy of the regions growing crops 
such as plantation, cotton and oil seeds in which foreign trade is important. 
With liberalization, 
the issue of efficiency has become highly r
elevant  as domestic production has to compete with 
products of other countries.  In the recent years domestic prices of several agricultural 
commodities have turned higher than international prices. India is not able to check import of a 
large number of c
ommodities even at high tariff. This is true not only in the case of import from 
developed countries where agriculture is highly subsidized but also in the case of products from 
developing countries. India is facing severe import competition in the case of
 
items like palm oil 
from Malaysia and Indonesia, spices from Vietnam, China and Indonesia, tea from Sri Lanka and 
rice from Thailand and Vietnam (Planning Commission, 2007). 
To compete in the global market, 
the country needs to reduce various post
-
 
harves
t costs and undertake suitable reforms to 
improve efficiency of domestic markets and delivery systems. 
To be able to successfully 
compete in a liberalized trade regime, therefore, there is need for a paradigm shift from merely 
maximizing growth to achievin
g efficient growth. 
For farmers, perhaps the single most adverse 
effect has been 
the combination of low prices and output volatility for cash crops
.
 
The effect of 
volatility in international prices on domestic agriculture should be checked by aligning tari
ffs 
with the changing price situation. 
 
 
Impact of 
climate change
: 
Climate change is a major challenge for agriculture, food security and 
rural livelihoods for millions of people including the poor in India.
 
Adverse impact will be more 
on small holding far
mers. 
Climate change is expected to have adverse impact on the living 
conditions of farmers, fishers and forest
-
dependent people who are already vulnerable and food 
insecure. Rural communities, particularly those living in already fragile environments, fac
e an 
immediate and ever
-
growing risk of increased crop failure, loss of livestock, and reduced 
availability of marine, aquaculture and forest products.
 
They would have adverse effects on food 
security and livelihoods of small farmers in particular.
 
In orde
r to have climate change sensitive 
and pro
-
poor policies, there is a need to focus on small farmers. 
Agriculture 
adaptation and 
mitigation could provide benefits for small farmers. The coping strategies would be useful to 
have long term adaptation strategi
es.
 
There is a significant potential for small farmers to 
sequester soil carbon if appropriate policy reforms are implemented. 
The importance of 
collective action in climate change adaptation and mitigation is recognized. Research and 
practice have shown t
hat collective action institutions are very important for technology transfer 
in agriculture and natural resource management among small holders and resource dependent 
communities. 
 
 
 
Water problems
:
 
Water is the leading input in agriculture. Development o
f irrigation and water 
management are crucial for raising levels of living in rural areas.
 
Agriculture has to compete for 
water with urbanization, drinking water and industrialization. As mentioned above, small holding 
agriculture depend more on ground wat
er compared to large farmers who has more access on 
canal water. Ground water is depleting in many areas of India. Marginal and small farmers are 
going to face more problems regarding water in future. Therefore, water management is going to 
be crucial for 
these farmers (more on this below).  
 
 
Diversification
:
 
There has been diversification of Indian diets away from foodgrains to high 
value products like milk and meat products and vegetables and fruits. The increasing middle
-
class due to rapid urbanization,
 
increasing per
-
capita income, increased participation of women 
11
 
 
in urban jobs and impact of globalization has been largely responsible for the diet diversification 
in India. Hi
-
value products have caught the fancy of the expanding middle class and the resu
lt is 
visible in the growing demand for hi
-
value processed products. There is growing demand for 
non
-
foodgrain items in India. The expenditure elasticity for non
-
cereal food items is still quite 
high in India. It is thrice as high when compared to cereals 
in the rural areas and over ten times 
as high in urban areas. Per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables showed the highest 
growth followed by edible oils. Diversification to high value crops and allied activities is one of 
the important sources for r
aising agricultural growth. Since risk is high for diversification, 
necessary support in infrastructure and marketing are needed. Price policy should also encourage 
diversification.
 
Small and marginal farmers can get higher incomes with diversification. Bu
t, 
there are risks in shifting to diversification as the support systems are more for food grains. 
There is a need for support systems for diversification to help the small holder farmers. 
 
 
Risk and vulnerability
:
 
There is enough evidence to suggest that 
poor and poorest of the poor 
households are vulnerable to a range of risks affecting individuals, households or whole 
communities which can have a devastating affect on their livelihoods and well being. 
They have 
higher exposure to a variety of risks at in
dividual or household level. Some of them are (a) health 
shocks: illness, injury, accidents, disability; (b) labour market risk: many work in informal sector 
and have high risk of unemployment and underemployment; (c)harvest risks, life cycle risks, social
 
risk and special risks for vulnerable groups. In addition, they have community risks such as 
droughts, floods, cyclones, structural adjustment policies etc.
 
Small and
 
marginal farmers are 
vulnerable to all these risks. 
Most of the coping mechanisms follow
ed by households are: 
borrowing, sale of assets, spending from savings, assistance from relatives and govt., expanded 
labour supply, child labour, bonded labour, reducing consumption, migration etc.
 
Comprehensive 
social protection programmes are required t
o address the negative effects due 
risks and 
vulnerabilities. 
India has many social protection programmes. The present major schemes for the 
poor in India  
fall into four broad categories: (i) food transfer like public distribution system 
(PDS) and supplem
entary nutrition (ii) self employment (iii) wage employment and (iv) social 
security programmes for unorganized workers.
 
The effectiveness of these programmes have to 
be improved so that small and marginal farmers can also benefit from these programmes. Cr
op 
insurance programmes and future markets have to be strengthened to reduce risks in price and 
yields.
 
 
3.4.
 
Opportunities for Small Holding Agriculture
 
 
Inspite of above challenges, there are many technological and institutional innovations which can 
ena
ble marginal and small farmers to raise agricultural productivity and increase incomes 
through diversification and high value agriculture.
 
 
Before goi
ng to technological innovations, we discuss below the policy issues under research and 
extension in agricu
lture. These are applicable to small and marginal farmers.
 
 
 
3.4.1. 
Research and Extension
 
The yield growth for many crops has declined in the 1990s. Technology plays an important role 
in improving the yields. The National Commission on Farmers also indica
tes that there is a large 

12
 
 
seems to be a technology fatigue in Indian agriculture. The yield gaps given y the Planning 
Commission (2007) are the following. 
 
 
T
he  2003
-
05 data show very large yield gaps:
 
 

 
Wheat: 6% (Punjab) to 84% (M.P.)
 

 
Rice: Over 100% in Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh and UP
 

 
Maize: 7% (Gujarat) to 300% (Assam)
 

 
Jowar:   13% (M.P.) to 200% (Karnataka)
 

 
Mustard: 5% (Haryana) to 150% (Chattisgarh)
 

 
Soybe
an: 7% (Rajasthan) to 185% (Karnataka)
 

 
Sugarcane: 16% (A.P.) to 167% (M.P.)
 
 
A fresh look at the priorities of Indian agricultural research system is necessary in light of 
emerging prospects. There is only marginal increase in the funds for research in the
 
recent 
budgets. Of course states have to take a lead in research and extension. It is known that India 
spends only 0.5 per cent of GDP on agricultural research as compared to more than 1 per cent by 
other developing countries. There is considerable potent
ial for raising the effectiveness of these 
outlays by reordering the priorities in agricultural research and redefining the relative roles of 
public and private sectors in research and extension
3
.
 
 
A review of the research and development activities of the
 
Indian Council of Agricultural 
Resarch (ICAR) system during the first two years of the 10
th
 
Plan revealed several weaknesses. 
Some of these are (a) there is inadequate emphasis on the needs of rainfed areas, which account 
for over 60% of cultivated area; 
(b) crop bias with major focus on rice and wheat; (c) 
proliferation of programmes resulting in resources being spread thinly and lack of focus in areas 
of relevance and opportunity; (d) inadequate priority to emerging challenges, particularly post
-
harvest,
 
marketing and environmental conservation; (e) the multiplicity of institutes with 
overlapping mandates has led to duplication of research work; (f) lack of accountability, less 
emphasis on multidisciplinary research, weak interaction among researchers, ex
tension workers 
and farmers and the private sector and, excessive centralization of planning and monitoring. A 
thorough reform of ICAR system is needed to address these weaknesses. 
 
 
There is a need to shift away from individual crop
-
oriented research focu
sed essentially on 
irrigated areas towards research on crops and cropping systems in the dry lands, hills, tribal and 
other marginal areas
4
. Dry land technology has to be improved. In view of high variability in 
agro
-
climatic conditions in such unfavourabl
e areas, research has to become increasingly 
location
-
specific with greater participation or interaction with farmers. Horticulture crops that are 
land
-
saving and water
-
saving should be encouraged in dry land areas. Research has to be 
improved on horticult
ure crops. 
 
 
Progress in post
-
harvest technology is essential to promote value addition through the growth of 
agro
-
processing industry. Private sector participation in agricultural research, extension and 
marketing is becoming increasingly important especi
ally with the advent of biotechnology and

protection being given to intellectual property. However, private sector participation tends to be 
limited to profitable crops and enterprises undertaken by resource rich farmers in well endowed 
regions. Moreover, 
private sector is not interested in research for better techniques of soil and 
water management, rainfed agriculture, cropping systems, environmental impact and long term 
sustainability. Therefore, 
the public sector research has to increasingly address the
 
problems 
facing the resource
-
poor farmers in the less endowed regions. The new agricultural technologies 
in the horizon are largely biotechnologies. Effective research is needed to have biotechnologies 
suitable to different locations in India.
 
 
Regarding 
extension, the existing Training and Visit (T and V) system of extension is top
-
down 
in its approach and there is little participation by the farmers. There is a need to take corrective 
steps to deal with the near collapse of the extension system in most s
tates. In the absence of 
public provision of such services, the resource poor and gullible farmers are becoming the 
victims of exploitation by the unscrupulous traders and money lenders interested in selling inputs 
such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides
. There is, therefore, an immediate need for reforming and 
revitalizing the existing agricultural extension system in the country. The main ingredient of 
reforms should be : (a) active involvement of farmers through user groups/associations; (b) 
participat
ion by the private sector and the NGOs; (c) increasing use of media and information 
technology including cyber kiosks to disseminate the knowledge on new agricultural practices 
and the information on output and input prices; and (d) building gender concern
s into the system, 
for example, by manning the extension services predominantly by women
5
.     
 
 
The returns to investment on research and extension will be much higher on agricultural growth 
as compared to other investments.

The need for adopting the methods of an evergreen revolution has become very urgent now. As 
Swaminathan (2010) mentions, among ot
her things, there are two major pathways to fostering an 
evergreen revolution. The first is organic farming. Productive organic farming needs 
considerable research support, particularly in the areas of soil fertility replenishment and plant 
protection. The
 
other pathway to an evergreen revolution is green agriculture. In this context, 
ecologically sound practices like conservation farming, integrated pest management, integrated 
nutrient supply and natural resources conservation are promoted. Green agricultu
re techniques 
could also include the cultivation of crop varieties bred through use of recombinant DNA 
technology if they are good in resisting to biotic and abiotic stresses or have other attributes like 
improving nutritive quality (Swaminathan, 2010).

helping small farmers in India. The improved whe
at varieties in Punjab and technology of single 
cross hybrid for maize have significantly contributed in enhancing yields in small farms. 

development in India is due
 
to 

asy
-
to
-
fit' technologies in the system. The study highlights a 
number of public sector driven improved technologies. These include: (a) productivity enhancing 
technologies; (b) input saving technologies; (c) nutrient balancing technologies; (d) value
 
adding 
technologies. The small interventions reduced crop damage, increased production 
and raised 
income both in domestic and export markets.
 
There are also technologies regarding efficient 
water management (more on this below).
 
 
Rural women play a signif
icant role in animal husbandry and are directly involved in major 
operations like feeding, breeding, management and health care. As the ownership of livestock is 
more evenly distributed with landless laborers, and marginal farmers, the progress in this sec
tor 
will result in a more balanced development of the rural economy, particularly in the reduction of 
poverty and malnutrition.
 
As Singh et al (2002) mention, priorities for live
-
stock technology 
development are animal health, nutrition, and reproduction.
 
 
Nutrient Management: 
Nitrogen applied in fertilizers, manures, biosolids and other N sources are 
not used efficiently by crops. Management strategies to improve the nitrogen use efficiency of 
crops which reduce fertilizer requirements focus on fertilizer 
best management practices. A note 
written for IFPRI by Flynn (2009) says that the best practices should look at application type, 
application rates, application timing and application placement. For example,  balancing 
application rates of nitrogen with ot
her required nutrients including phosphorus, potassium and 
sulphur is a major way of improving nitrogen use efficiency. Similarly, appropriate nitrogen 
application rates are important 
in order to have effectiveness on yields.
 
 
Another way
 
is switching to o
rganic production which can reduce fertilizer use. Better use of 
existing organic sources of nutrients, including animal manure, crop residues, and nitrogen
-
fixing crops such as legumes. Such organic nitrogen sources may also contribute to raising 
sequestr
ation of carbon in soils (Flynn, 2009). However, yields 
have to be maintained
 
with 
organic farming as compared to cultivation with chemical fertilizers. 
 
 
Bio
-
technology
: 
The term biotechnology covers a wide range of scientific techniques and 
products that
 
can be used in numerous ways to boost and sustain the productivity of crops, 
livestock, fisheries and forests. Though agricultural biotechnology is used synonymously with 
genetic modification by general public, there are many techniques in biotechnology a
part from 
genetic modification. 
The other techniques are 

genomics and bioinformatics, marketed
-
assisted 
15
 
 
selection, diagnostic procedures, micro propagation, tissue culture, cloning, artificial 
insemination, embryo transfer and other technologies (Rao and 
Dev, 2010).
 
 
Recently India had two revolutions in technology. One is BT cotton and the other is hybrid 
maize. 
Studies on Bt
 
cotton showed that small farmers benefited from the introduction of this 
technology. A study on four districts of Andhra Pradesh (W
arangal, Nalgonda, Guntur, Kurnool) 
examined, among other things, whether the b
enefits of Bt
 
Cotton technology are shared by all 
groups of farmers across social categories and size groups (Rao and Dev, 2010). The green 
re
volution technologies have been uti
lized by upper strata of farmers and later gradually spread 
to other strata. But in the case of biotechnological application, the small farmers and SC and ST 
farmers also made use of the technology well since the beginning. The small farmers growing Bt 
cot
ton have significantly improved their position compared to the non
-
Bt growing small farmers. 
The net income improved by 69 per cent and farm business 
income improved by 108 per cent. 
This clearly shows that the small farmers are better off with Bt cotton t
han without Bt cotton. 
Same is the case with Scheduled Castes (SCs). Bt cotton led to improving the net income by 59 
per cent. The farm business income is higher by three times than non
-
Bt farmers from SCs. 
Therefore, it is very clear that the farmers from
 
SCs, who are also generally small farmers, got 
benefited from adopting this technology.
 
Information technology
: 
Changes in information technology will help in a big way to improve 
agri
-
business and incomes of small farmers. Indian private companies and NG
Os are global 

leader in ICTs. 
E
-
Choupal 
has expanded access to internet in rural areas. Up to 6,400 internet 
kiosks were set up between 2000 and 2007 by ITC Lim
ited, one of the largest agricultural 
exporters. It reaches about 4 million farmers growing a range of crops 
-
 
soybean, coffee, wheat, 
rice, pulses or shrimp 
-
 
in over 40,000 villages. They get free information in their language about 
local and global mark
et prices, weather forecasts, farming practices and crop insurance. It serves 
as a purchase centre, cutting marketing costs and allowing farmers to obtain a bigger farm price. 
The M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation established Knowledge Centers in Pondi
cherry in 
1997. With the support of the Indian Space Research Organization, centers in each village are 
connected by satellite to a hub at Villianur. The women self
-

computers to manage their business accounts and coordinate the
ir activities, using video links 
with the other villages. 
 
 
The declining costs of ICTs are giving 
small 
farmers much greater access to information. Mobile 
phone coverage in India is expanding at breakneck speed. Nokia sold several lakhs of new 
mobile phon
e handsets, and new subscriptions are averaging 6 million a month, many in rural 
areas. Computers are now being linked through mobile phone networks to greatly expand the 
scope of information. By linking communication technologies to market exchanges in 
co
mmercial centers, even small farmers can overcome the enormous informational asymmetries 
that limit their bargaining power in traditional supply chains. The revolution in mobile phones is 
helping the small farmers to get information about crop prices and i
nput prices and other related 
information on agriculture.
 
 
3.4.3. 
Institutional Innovations
 
Small holding agriculture faces many challenges. But, a number of innovative institutional 
models are emerging 
and there are many opportunities for small and margin
al farmers in India. 
Institutions relating to (a) land and water management, (b) group or cooperative approach for 
16
 
 
inputs and marketing and, (c) value chains and super markets can enhance productivity, 
sustainability and incomes of small holding agricultur
e.
 
Institutions for sustainable land and water management
 
Development of irrigation and water management are crucial for raising levels of living in rural 
areas
6
.
 
Major areas of concern in irrigation are: decline in real investment, thin spread of 
investme
nt, low recovery of costs, decline in water table, wastages and inefficiencies in water 
use and, non
-
involvement of users
 
Both investment and efficiency in use of water are needed. 
Major areas of reforms needed in irrigation are: stepping up and prioritizi
ng public investment, 
raising profitability of groundwater exploitation and augmenting ground water resources, rational 
pricing of irrigation water and electricity, involvement of user farmers in the management of 
irrigation systems and, making groundwater
 
markets equitable (Rao, 2005). In a recent study, 
Shah et al (2009) indicate that t
he impact of the drought of 2009 is expected be less severe than 
the drought of 2002
 
due to ground water recharge in the last few years. Ground water can be 
exploited in a 
big way in Eastern region. W
atershed development and, water conservation by the 
community are needed under water management.
 
New watershed guidelines based on 

2009. The
 
implementation has to be stepped up in order to obtain benefits in rainfed areas. 
National Rainfed Area Authority has big responsibility in matters relating to water conservation 
and watershed development. Assets created under NREGS can help in improving 
land and water 
management. 
 
 
Environmental concerns are among the policy priorities in India. Particularly degradation of land 
and water is alarming. Watershed development under the new guidelines, in general, has an 
overall positive impact on environment.
 
However, groundwater tables are depleting at an 
alarming rate. The 
de facto
 
privatization of groundwater and subsidized power supply are the 
main culprits. There has been a neglect of minor irrigation sources like tanks. Shortage of 
drinking water has acc
entuated and quality of water has declined over time.
 
 
An integrated approach is needed for water resources management in the country. An appropriate 
strategy should integrate institutional approaches with market principles. Since institutional 
innovation 
(Water user associations) is already in place for canal irrigation, it is time now to 
implement volumetric pricing. There is a need to de
-
link water rights from land rights in order to 
ensure equity and sustainability.
 
 
Institutions like the water user ass
ociations (WUAs) and watershed committees are important for 
water management. The experience of Andhra Pradesh shows that the impact of WUAs has been 
encouraging in these areas. especially in terms of providing irrigation to tail end farmers. This 
has been
 
made possible by cleaning of canals and water courses and monitoring of water losses 
by the WUAs. Area under paddy is reported to have increased significantly following reforms. 
However, much of the reported increase could be statistical because of underr
eporting of 
irrigated area before reform , as this  meant lesser payment  of water tax to revenue department. 
Paddy yields are reported to have increased by 40%. Long term solution for effective functioning 
of WUAs is awareness building and promoting parti
cipatory monitoring and  evaluation. Unlike 
in the case of canal irrigation, WUAs are not found to be  effective in respect of tank irrigation  
due to insufficient allocations.

In the case of land and forestry, watershed approach and Joint Forest Managem
ent are crucial for 
protecting the environment. The critical issue is sustainability of these programmes. Although 
watersheds have shown positive economic impact, the social issues are missing. More 
participatory approach and involvement of women would lea
d to sustainability of watershed 
development approach. In the case of JFM, the focus is more on high income areas like timber. 
Low value products constituting sources of livelihoods for the poor have low priority. Customary 
rights of the tribals on 
podu 
(s
hifting cult
ivation) have to be recognised.
 
Awareness 
and 
involvement of the civil society is a precondition for checking environmental degradation. 
Environmental  movements would have a discerning impact in this regard.
 
 
Another concern is the land degrad
ation due to excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. 
Government has programmes such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Nutrient 
Management (INM). Keeping in view the ill effects of pesticides and also National Policy on 
Agriculture, In
tegrated Pest Management Approach (IPM) approach has been adopted as a 
cardinal principle and main plank of plant protection in the country in the overall crop 
production programme. Besides ongoing activities, the thrust area will be pertaining to Pest Ris
k 
Analysis (PRA) and post entry quarantine surveillance. This has become essential in the light of 
WTO agreement, which will facilitate more and speedier movement of plants, planting materials 
globally.

group efforts, where they do not already exist, should be promoted  to overcome constraints of 
small and uneconomic land holdings, for the dissemination of agricultural technology and other 
inputs, as well as for marketing
 
of produce (Agarwal, 2010).

level from
 
over 15 departments of the government, and over 1500 scientists, are involved in the 

Mohatsava
 
serves as an institutional platform at the village level 
and proved to be an important support for farmers. 
 
 
An initiative in And
hra Pradesh based on the Self Help Group (SHG) provides another example 
of an institutional platform for agriculture. The Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture 
(CMSA) programme was initiated by the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP) in 
And
hra Pradesh in 2004. The mandate of the program is to eradicate poverty and to improve 
18
 
 
livelihoods of the poor. It may also help in nutrition because of improvements in livelihoods. The 
initiative aims to address the major causes of agriculture distress an
d helps farmers in adopting 
sustainable agricultural practices. CMSA has now reached 8033 villages in 503 mandals of all 22 
districts (Raturi, 2011). It covers about 2.7 million acres and benefit about 1.05 million farmers.
 
 
Institutions
 
for Marketing
 
of S
mall Holdings
 
 
For small and marginal farmers, marketing of their products is main problem apart from credit 
and extension. In recent years , there has been some form of contract arrangements in several 
agricultural crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, chilli
es, gherkin, baby corn, rose, onions, cotton, 
wheat, basmati rice, groundnut, flowers, and medicinal plants. There is a silent revolution in 
institutions regarding non
-
cereal foods. New production 

market linkages in the food supply 
chain are: spot or open
 
market transactions, agricultural co
-
operatives and contract farming 
(Joshi and Gulati, 2003). 
 
 
One of the most 
successful 
producer organization is the Indian dairy cooperative which in 2005  
had 
a net work of more than 100,000 village level dairy cooper
atives with 12.
3 million members 
(see Birthal et al 2008).
 
 
Contract farming has a potential to help the small and marginal farmers overcome constraints in 
accessing inputs, credit, extension and marketing.  In recent years, there has been some form of 
con
tract arrangements in several agricultural crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, chilies, gherkin, 
baby corn, rose, onions, cotton, wheat, basmati rice, groundnut, flowers, and medicinal plants 
and is spreading throughout India in states like Andhra Pradesh (D
ev and Rao, 2005), Tamil 
Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab and Maharashtra. 
 
 
While the pros of contract farming are potentially many, the sponsoring companies may be 
unreliable, may exploit a monopoly position, and/or have inefficient management and marketing 
probl
ems that could result in manipulation of quota and non
-
fulfillment of commitments. 
Contract farming in India is neither backed up by law nor by an efficient legal system. This is the 
single most constraint to widespread use of contract farming in India. Th
e legal system can be 
improved with legislative measures like the model contract and code of practice, registration of 
contracts with marketing committees and tribunals for efficient, speedy and corrupt
-
free dispute 
resolutions.
 
 
 
There is a need to revamp
 
some of the legal hurdles for agro processing and APMC Act
7
. 
Several 
State Governments have already
 
amended their APMC Acts allowing varying degrees
 
of 
flexibility. However several States are yet to notify the relevant
 
rules that would make the 
amendment 
fully operational.
 
These steps should be speedily completed to
 
provide a boost to 
promotion of direct marketing,
 
contract farming, and setting up of markets in private
 
and co
-
operative sectors.
 
 
Most important problem for the 
small 
farmers is output price 
fluctuations. There is a big gap 
between producer prices and consumer prices. 
There are different models for marketing 
collectively by the small and marginal farmers. These are: self help group model, co
-
operative 
model, small producer co
-
operatives and co
ntract farming.

-
operatives are some of the successful cases in marketing. The real 
challenge lies in organising the small and marginal farmers for marketing and linking them to 
high value agricu
lture.
 
Thus, group approach is needed for getting benefits from marketing.
 
 
Super markets and supply chains
: 
Small farmers can benefit from the emerging super markets 
and value chains. 
The 
presence 
of super markets as retail trade 
is rapidly expanding in t
he 
emerging economies. According to Reardon
 
and Gulati (2008)
, this process has developed in an 
astonishing speed: Supermarkets now enjoy a retail share of 50
-
60% in South America, East 
Asia (China excluded) and South Africa; and a 30
-
50% in Mexico, Centra
l America and much of 
South East Asia. While in China, India and Vietnam their market is still low and variable (2
-
20%), it is experiencing an annual growth between 30% and 50%. 
 
 
Reardon and Minten (2011
a
) examine the patterns and dynamics of diffusion of
 
modern food 
retail in India. They emphasized three surprises in the rise of modern food retail in India. They 
are: 

that the private retail wave has been ex
tremely fast in particular in its second phase, in the pst 6 years, 
when it grew at 49% per year on average, some 5 times faster than the fast growth being experienced in 
the GDP; (3) that the rise of private retail chains has been unique or rare in is dri
vers (in its great majority 


developing countries) in its penetration of the food markets of the poor, of small cities and even rural 
areas, of fresh prod
uct markets, and its use of diverse formats to help toward the above ends

Reardon and Minten, 2011
a
). 
 
 
 
In a study on food supply chains in India, Reardon and Minten (2011) indicate the following 
changes in the past two decades. 
 
 
(1)
 
A modern sector 
is emerging in the whole sale sector with the growth of moden logistics 
firms and specialized modern wholesalers. 
 
(2)
 
Tradition segment of the whole sale sector is also transforming. Based on earlier studies, 
this study presents the findings on transformation
 
of traditional whole sale sector as 
follows.
 
(a)
 
Rural traditional market transformation
 
is much more advanced in certain regions For 
example, West and Central regions of Madhya Pradesh and West and Central Uttar 
Pradesh 
 
are different from Eastrn regions of 
these states. 
 
(b)
 
The marginal farms (0
-
1 hectare) look more like traditional rural India with low 
market surplus, chemical use, credit use, lower use of clod stores etc. On the other 
hand, small and medium farmers are more dynamic.
 
(c)
 
The conventional view is t
hat food supply chains are dominated by long chain of 
many hands. The recent findings show that supply chains can be short.
 
(d)
 
Conventional view is that farmers are at the mercy of money lender of because of tied 
credit. But, the surveys show that less than 5
 
per cent take advance or credit in any 
form from brokers or wholesalers. 
 
(e)
 
The surveys show rapid development of cold stores for potato in Uttar Pradesh and 
Bihar in 2000s. 
 
 
In India, the expansion of modern retailing has the potential to spark investment
 
in marketing 
efficiency and processing that yields benefits to both producers and consumers. 
In those cases 
20
 
 
where small producers have been able to integrate into the supplying chains, supermarkets have 
offered enhanced security and considerably higher ma
rgins than the traditional clients, such as 
wholesales and groceries. However, there is scope for exploitation in contract farming and super 
markets if rules are not framed properly.
 
 
3.5. Policies to Support to Small Holders
 
In the case of small holding a
griculture, Government has to play an important
 
role in 
improving 
productivity and incomes of small farmers. 
The 11
th
 
Five Year Plan says that 

the agricultural 
strategy must focus on 
85
% of farmers who are small and marginal, increasingly female, and 
who 
find it difficult to access inputs, credit and extension or to market their output. While some 
of these farmers may ultimately exit from farming, the overwhelming majority will continue to 
remain in the sector and the objective of inclusiveness requires th
at their needs are attended to

(p.8
, Vol.3)
. 
 
 
The National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector (NCEUS) has 
recommended a special programme for marginal and small farmers. The report of NCEUS 
analyses the status and constraints faced by m
arginal and small farmers and focuses on the need 
for a special programme which aimed at capacity building of these farmers, both the farm and 
non
-
farm activities.
 
As the marginal and small farmers suffer from market failures in agriculture 
in terms of cre
dit, input supplies and marketing of output, accessto new technologies etc. NCUS 
recommended the four measures. These are: (a) Special programmes for maginal and small 
farmers; (b) Emphasis on accelerated land and water management; (c) credit for marginal 
and 

 
 
The Commission st
rongly advocates that a strategy for marginal and small farmers must focus on 
group approaches in order to benefit from the economies of scale. A focused approach can be 
used to ince

other can facilitate in finding solutions to problems of irrigation, inputs, procurement, markets 
and risk. The Commission has considered four important models for group app
roach in the 
country. These are: Co
-


 
 

em to hold greater 
promise for expansion. It may be noted that formation of marginal and small farmers

is the capacity building and group f
ormation among the poor marginal and small farmers can not 
be simply seen as an extension of routine departmental activity and as one of the many activities 

promoted where 

 
not operating.
 
 
The elements of special programmes advocated by NCEUS (2008) are the following
 
(a)
 

help groups (SHGs) are few. Special efforts hav
e to be made to facilitate formation of 

21
 
 
Development Society (MSFDS) for the promotion, capacity building and coordination of 

ups.
 
(b)
 

groups to banks is an essential step towards needed credit flow to these farmers.
 
(c)
 
Training and capacity building: The special programme aims at motivating and enablin
g 
marginal and small farmers to acquire skills 
by establishing Community Resource 
Centres, by promoting marginal and small farmer activists at the village, cluster and 
block levels.
 
(d)
 
Support for strengthening and creation of non
-
farm activities: This aims t
o bridge the 
farm activities and non
-
farm activities of small holding agriculture as income from small 
farming is hardly sufficient to meet the basic needs of the farm households.
 
(e)
 
Gender
-
focused activities: It is known that the share of women is increasing
 
in 

representation of women farmers.
 
(f)
 
Planning for development of Marginal and Small Farmers: The Marginal and Small 

lopment strategy for 
these farmers.
 
 
Rural non
-
farm 
sector
 
As mentioned above, the income from small and marginal farms is not enough to take care of 
daily consumption and they have to borrow to survive. Therefore, small holdings farmers have to 
get part o
f income from rural non
-
farm
 
activities. Therefore, promotion of rural non
-
farm sector 
is essential for generating incomes for rural population. 
Poverty can not be removed with 55% of 
workers in agricultural sector.
 
Ultimately, many of the small and margin
al farmers have to be 
shifted to rural non
-
farm sector and urban areas. 
 
 
 
India currently produces about 50 million tonnes of fruits and 90 million tonnes of vegetables. 
Only 2% of these fruits and vegetables are processed as against 23% in China, 78% in 
Phillippines, 83% in Malaysia. 
Half of those engaged in agriculture are still illiterate and 
just 5% 
have 
completed higher secondary education. Even in 2004
-
05, around 
60% of rural male workers 
and 85% of rural female workers are either illiterate
 
or have 
been educated upto primary level. In 
other words, 
education and skills are constraints.
 
India can learn from China on rural 
transformation.
 
China experienced a structural transformation in the last three decades. The 

ing up  the  physical and social infrastructure (including 
land reforms). India should learn from China on reforms in agricultural growth, rural non
-
farm 
employment, public investment and human development. The impact of growth on poverty 
reduction is quit
e significant (Rao, 2007). China started with agricultural reforms. Agricultural 
growth was quite high. The economic and institutional reforms in the whole economy created 
space for rural non
-
farm sector (TVEs and others). Diversification towards rural non
-
form sector 
in China is  one of  the important factors responsible  for rural poverty  reduction (poverty is only 
3%). This was partly due to agricultural productivity.  
 
 
Rural Infrastructure Development
 
Regarding protection of agriculture in OECD countr
ies, some suggest that developing countries 
also should protect their agriculture. However, a better option is to provide more rural and 
agricultural goods that are undersupplied by the market (Lipton, 2006). It also includes rural 
22
 
 
infrastructure developme
nt like roads, irrigation, communications etc. Returns are also high from 
investments in agricultural R&D, rural roads and other infrastructure and knowledge generation 
(Hazell, 2011). The rural infrastructure will enable small and marginal farmers to comp
ete with 
other famers in India as well as in other countries. 
 
 
4. 
LESSONS FROM INDIAN EXPERIENCE
 
Indian experience on small hold
ing agriculture provides some
 
lessons for developing countries. 
 
 
(a) 
Green revolution
 
and Small Farms

n which started in the mid
-
1960s 
heralded a new era in Indian agriculture. The cultivation of high yielding varieties of seeds at 
recommended dosages of fertilizers were encouraged in water assured areas.
 
Initially, t
he 
medium and large farmers in irrigate
d areas benefited 
from the new technology. However, small 
holding agriculture also benefited from green revolution because of government support in 
accessing 
services.  
 
 
 
(b) 
Food 
grains 
management
:
 
The food grains management policy of India consists of t
hree 
instruments: (a) minimum support prices and procurement; (b) buffer stock and (c) public 
distribution system. During 2006
-
08, there were significant increase in global food prices of rice 
and wheat. In the case of India, food grain prices increased on
ly around 10 per cent as compared 
to global food price increase of 80 to 90 per cent. 
Food grain management is partly responsible 
for insulation from the rise of global food grain prices. Small and marginal farmers also 
benefited 
 
from these policies.
 
 
 
(c
) 
Dairy cooperatives
:
 
 
Other countries can learn from the dairy cooperatives in India. 

s 
dairy sector is dominated by smallholders, and contractin
g with a large number of them involves 
transaction costs 
for the processors. The processors do not
 
have much choice but to take milk 
from smallholder
 
producers. The problem of the higher cost of contracting with small producers 
is overcome by contracting
 
with a single person in the village

often an agent

who acts as an 
intermediary between the processor
 
and producers
 
(Birthal et al, 2008)
.
 
 
 
National Dairy Development Board covers 1,40, 227 village level societies and 14 million farm 
families
 
of which 4 million are women. It has a daily pro
curement of 22 million liters of milk
8
. 
Amul
 
Pattern of dairy cooperatives have contributed immensely to the fact that India has 
progressed from a milk
-
deficit country to emerge as the largest milk
-
producing nation in the 
world. In the process, they have g
enerated millions of days of employment for the rural poor and 
improved their socio
-
economic condition
9
.
 
 
(d) 
Water management in Gujarat
:
 
The government of Gujarat
 
played an important role in the 
Gujarat miracle for agriculture in 2000s. 
Gujarat has recor
ded
 
high and steady growth at 9.6% 
per year in agricultural state domestic product since 1999
-
2000. 
What are the factors responsible 

he Gujarat government has aggressively 
pursued an innovative agricu
lture development programme by liberalising markets, inviting 
private capital, reinventing agricultural extension, improving roads and other infrastructure

. 
If it 
is only canal irrigation, high growth should have been mainly in 
South and Central Gujarat
.

However, the evidence shows that 
dry Saurashtra and Kachchh, and North Gujarat that have 
been at the forefront. 

These could not have performed so well but for the improved availability 
of groundwater for irrigation. Arguably, mass
-
based water harvesting a
nd farm power reforms 


.
 
This is possible due to more than 
100,000 check dams and major programme on Khet Talavadi (water ponds in the fields).

(e) 
Self Help groups and group approach
:
 
The wom

(SHG) 
movement 
particularly SHG
-
bank linkage programme 
has spread all over the country. As mentioned above, 
there are two successful models in the country. 
One is Andhra Pradesh model and the other is 

terventions and processes have resulted in a sustained 
process of empowerment of its women members. 
The real power of the 
SHG
-
bank linkage 
model (
SBL model
)
 
lies in the economies of scale created by Self Help
 
Group (SHG) 

 
purchase of 
inputs (seeds, fertilisers etc.) and marketing of outputs (crops, vegetables, milk,
 
NTFPs etc).
 
Government of India has now started National Rural Liv
elihoods Mission (NRLM) in 2011. 
There is a clear understanding that the
 
SBL programme can only be successful if it is tied up 
with livelihood programmes such as
 
improved agriculture, dairying, marketing etc.
 
 
 
(f) 
Institutional innovations
:
 
As discussed a
bove, there are many institutional innovations in 
input services, land water management and output marketing for marginal and small farmers. 
Other countries can learn from these experiences.
 
 
(g) 
Rights based approach
:
 
India has been rights approach for se
veral development programmes 
and to maintain transparency. The country has 
Right to Information, 100 days of guaranteed 
unskilled employment under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
,
 
Right to Education. It 
is also going for Right to Food by introducin
g National Food Security Act.
 
These rights approach 
puts pressures on governments to deliver the services to citizens.  Basically we have to go 
beyond supply side and focus on demand side. Social pressures are needed for public action. 
Better monitoring sy
stems have to be developed at Central, state, district and village levels to 
realize rights. Justiciability is one aspect of rights. However, one (particularly the poor) can not 
go to court every time right is violated. It is the responsibility of citizens
 
and NGOs to organize  
campaigns for better functioning of the programmes. Public accountability is crucial for the 
success of right
s approach
. 
 
 
(h
) 
Learning from others
: India also can learn from countries like China and Brazil on 
agriculture and other p
olicies on reducing poverty. India can learn from China on 
agricultural 
transformation, 
education, infrastructure, macro policies, doing business, equitable asset 
distri
bution and
, rural non
-
farm
 
sector development. Similarly, Latin American Countries like
 
Brazil can offer lessons to India on agriculture research (e.g.Agriculture research corporation 
EMBRAPA) and Zero hunger programme.

Stirring the Pyramid Agriculture, farming, micro-enterprises &amp; BOP social

&lt;\- Regression and decision trees in agriculture Who overuses fertilizers?
Who underuses them? -&gt; ## Farm size trends across different states Posted
on August 20, 2012 by Richa ![Madhya Pradesh
farms](https://stirringthepyramid.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_0461ed.jpg?w=300&amp;h;=224)
Madhya Pradesh farms Recently I visited Madhya Pradesh and visited a village
with average landholding of 20 acres.  Given that the national average
landholding is around 2.5 acres, I was intrigued. I talked with farmers, many
of whom owned 7 acres, 20 acres, and 70 acres of land.  Agri-sector
professionals whom I met during my visit stated that the average land holding
in MP is larger than in UP.  Driving around rural areas I could see large
fields (by UP standards) ploughed by tractors. So upon my return I looked up
the farm size numbers by state.  The data confirmed that land holdings in MP
are indeed more than double that of UP, averaging 2 ha (5 acres) versus .8 ha
(2 acres).  One hectare is approx 2.5 acres. But the data also threw up some
interesting points about other states. **Region/ State** | **Average holding
in 2005-06 (hectares)** \---|--- **ALL INDIA** | **1.23** North | | Haryana |
2.23 | Punjab | 3.95 | Uttrakhand | 0.94 | Uttar Pradesh | 0.80 | Chhattisgarh
| 1.51 | Madhya Pradesh | 2.02 South | | Andhra Pradesh | 1.20 | Karnataka |
1.63 | Kerala | 0.23 | Tamil Nadu | 0.83 West | | Gujarat | 2.20 | Rajasthan |
3.38 | Maharashtra | 1.46 East | | Orissa | 1.15 | West Bengal | 0.79 | Bihar
| 0.43 NE | | | Assam | 1.11 | Arunachal Pradesh | 3.33 ** Changes in farm
land holding ** As expected, we see larger landholdings in Punjab &amp;
Haryana, but Arunachal also has larger farm sizes, as do Gujarat and
Rajasthan.  Nagaland was a surprise with the largest average land holding in
the country and Kerala the smallest. Next, I looked for trends over time to
see how farm sizes have changed over the years. That turned out to be even
more difficult to find than expected. So I decided to put together my own
tables by pulling data from multiple years. Previously on Stirring the Pyramid
I had written about farm size trends at an all-India level (see here and here)
covering decades from 1960s to recent times. Between 1996 and 2006, farm sizes
shrunk by an average of 13% in India overall.  However, there are very
interesting differences across states. Punjab and Haryana bucked the national
trend and experienced a consolidation of farms, registering a 5% growth over
the time period. The smaller states of Goa and Nagaland show a much stronger
consolidation trend with ~40% increase in land holding sizes. Unfortunately, I
couldn’t get comparable numbers for three of the states that I was most
interested in learning more about: UP, MP and Bihar, since all of them have
been split recently, and the GOI did not bother restating older data for the
split states. **Region/ State** | **2006** | **1996** | **%change 1996 to
2006** \---|---|---|--- **ALL INDIA** | **1.23** | **1.41** | **-13%** North |
| | | Haryana | 2.23 | 2.13 | 5% | Punjab | 3.95 | 3.79 | 4% | Himachal
Pradesh | 1.04 | 1.16 | -10% South | | | | Andhra Pradesh | 1.20 | 1.36 | -12%
| Karnataka | 1.63 | 1.95 | -16% | Kerala | 0.23 | 0.27 | -15% | Tamil Nadu |
0.83 | 0.91 | -9% West, NW | | | | Gujarat | 2.20 | 2.62 | -16% | Rajasthan |
3.38 | 3.96 | -15% | Maharashtra | 1.46 | 1.87 | -22% | Goa | 1.15 | 0.84 |
37% East | | | | Orissa | 1.15 | 1.30 | -12% | West Bengal | 0.79 | 0.85 | -7%
NE | | | | | Assam | 1.11 | 1.17 | -5% | Arunachal Pradesh | 3.33 | 3.31 | 1%
| Meghalaya | 1.18 | 1.33 | -11% | Nagaland | 6.93 | 4.83 | 43% Interesting to
note that Gujarat, despite its recent agriculture GDP growth, followed the
national average rate of farm size reduction. Maharashtra registered the
greatest shrinkage at 22%. Could this rapid change in landholding be one of
the causes of the agricultural woes of parts of the state? Note: I have
removed some rows from data tables to make the post more readable. ### Rate

Tamil Nadu Agricultural University releases pest and disease forecast Adarsh
Jain The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University on Monday released a forecast to
help farmers to adopt preventive measures to save crops and prevent loss in
yield. | TNN | Oct 12, 2015, 09.43 PM IST COIMBATORE: With frequent showers in
the last two weeks, the risk of pest attacks and diseases in agricultural
crops has increased. The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University on Monday released
a forecast to help farmers to adopt preventive measures to save crops and
prevent loss in yield. The Centre for Plant Protection Studies, department of
entomology and department of plant pathology have together released a pest and
disease forecast for seven agricultural crops- paddy, cotton, tomato,
turmeric, sugarcane, groundnut and maize. Paddy: TNAU scientists have
identified leaf folder and stem borer diseases in the crops in Tirunelveli,
Salem, Kanyakumari, Theni, Thiruvarur, Villupuram, Dharmapuri, Madurai,
Thanjavur and Pudukottai. To save the crops from further attack, farmers are
advised to spray neem seed kernel extract 5% along with sticking agent 1
ml/lit. Farmers can also set up light traps (one/acre) to monitor the pest
population. If needed, farmers can spray one of the following insecticides:
Phosphamidon 40SL 225 ml/acre or Profenofos 50EC 400 ml/acre. The experts have
also predicted the possibility of an outbreak of paddy blast. Hence, the
farmers are advised to spray hexaconazole (0.25%) twice a week. Besides,
foliar application of 0.2% Pseudomonas fluorescens at fortnightly interval is
recommended to increase the yield. Cotton: The centres of TNAU in Dharmapuri
and Madurai districts have identified sucking pests in the crop. The experts
suggest the farmers to setup yellow sticky traps (5/acre) to monitor the pest
population. On the other hand, to manage cotton bollworms, farmers can set up
pheromone trap (5/acre) depending on the type of bollworm. If needed, they can
spray indoxacarb 14.5 SC 200 ml/acre or triazophos 40 EC 800 ml/acre. Tomato:
It was noticed that the crops in Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur and Dindugul
districts were affected with tomato leaf blight. To avoid further attack, TNAU
scientists suggest to spray mancozeb (dissolve 2g in 1l water) twice a week.
Turmeric: Erode is a trade hub for turmeric, and crops in Erode, Coimbatore
and Tiruppur districts have been identified with turmeric leaf spot by the
TNAU scientists. To avoid loss in yield, which will in turn affect the market
prices, experts advised farmers to spray mancozeb (dissolve 2g in 1l water) or
propiconazole 0.2% twice a week. Sugarcane: In Salem, Sivaganga, Theni,
Thiruvannamalai, Pudukottai and Villupuram, borer pest complex were found
below the economic threshold level. However, TNAU scientists advise farmers to
release the egg parasitoid Trichogramma 2.5cc/ha to avoid further attack.
Groundnut: The crop grown in Erode, Salem, Sivagangai, Thiruvannamalai,
Villupuram, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram has been found affected with leaf
miner. If the rainfall levels are not normal, scientists predict that the pest
may exceed the economic threshold level, thus affecting the yield. To avoid
consequences, farmers have been advised to spray neem seed kernel extract 5%
along with sticking agent 1ml/l. Besides leaf miner, scientists have also
spotted dry root rot in few crops. Farmers can spray 0.1% carbendazim in the
soil, scientists say. Maize: It has been found that crops in Coimbatore,
Tiruppur, Madurai, Pudukottai and Dharmapuri have been affected with stem
borer. Farmers are advised to monitor the adult moths by setting up light
traps and, if needed, spray neem seed kernel extract 5% along with sticking
agent 1ml/l. RELATED ## From around the web ## More from The Times of India

management Pink Borer (Sesamia inference) Sesamia inference occurs during
winter season particularly in peninsular India. The moth of the Sesamia is
nocturnal and lays eggs on lower leaf sheath. The larvae of the Sesamia enter
the plant near the base and cause damage to stem. \--- ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize3.png) | ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize4.png) | Control of Chilo and Sesamia: For
control of Chilo and Sesamia, foliar spray of 0.1 % Endosulfan {700 ml (35 EC)
in 250 litre water} 10 days after germination is very effective. The Chilo can
also be controlled by release of 8 Trichocards (Trichogramma chilonis) per
hectare at 10 days after germination. Intercropping of maize with suitable
varieties of cowpea is an eco-friendly option for reducing the incidence of
Chilo on maize. Shoot fly (Atherigona sp.) In South India it is a serious pest
but it also appears on spring and summer maize crop in North India. It attack
mainly at seedling stage of the crop. The tiny maggots creep down under the
leaf sheaths till they reach the base of the seedlings. After this they cut
the growing point or central shoot which results in to dead heart formation.
\--- **Control of Shootfly** Sowing must be completed before first week of
February so that the crop will escape shootfly infestation. Spring sowing must
be accompanied with seed treatment with Imidacloprid @ 6ml/kg seed. | ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize5.png) Stem Borer (Chilo partellus) Major pest of
maize in India is Stalk borer. Chilo partellus, popularly known as stalk borer
that occurs during monsoon season is a major pest throughout the country.
Chilo lays eggs 10-25 days after germination on lower side of the leaves. The
larva of the Chilo enters in the whorl and cause damage in the leaves | ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize1.png) | ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize2.png) \---|---|--- Termites (Odontotermes
obesus) ![Pest Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize6.png). | Termite is also an
important pest in many areas. For control of termite fepronil granules should
be applied @ 20 kg ha-1 followed by light irrigation. If the termite incidence
is in patches, than spot application of fepronil @ 2-3 granuled/plant should
be done. Clean cultivation delays termite attack. \---|--- Other emerging
pests Recently some other non-traditional pests are also causing damage to
maize crop viz. larvae of American Bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) which
causes damage to cob in Southern part of India while the Chaffer beetle
(Chiloloba acuta) feeds on maize pollen which adversely affects pollination in
northern part of India. | ![Pest Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize7.png)
**American bollworm** | ![Pest Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize8.png) **Chaffer
beetle** \---|---|--- Disease Management Across the country several diseases
occurs during different seasons, if they are not managed at proper time than
they leads to yield loss. BLSB, Pythium stalk rot, Bacterial stalk rot, PFSRs,
Polysora rust and Downy mildews are the major constraints to be tackled for
realizing genetic potential yield of the crop. Estimated losses due to major
diseases of maize in India is about 13.2% of which foliar diseases (5 %),
stalk rots, root rots, ear rots (5 %) cause major yield losses. The major
diseases and their management practices are described as below: Turcicum leaf
blight (Exserohilum turcicum) The disease is prevalent in cooler condition
with high humidity of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, West
Bengal, Meghalaya, Tripura, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu. Long, elliptical, grayish green or tan lesions (2.5-15 cm) appear
on lower leaves progressing upward. Grow PEMH-5, Vivek 21, Vivek 23, Vivek 25,
Pratap Kanchan 2, Nithyashree in the recommended areas followed by need based
sprays of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/litre (with adjuant @ 0.05%) at 8-10 days interval.
\--- ![Pest Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize9.png) ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize10.png) ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize11.png) Turcicum leaf blight (Exserohilum
turcicum) It is a major disease in the states of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal
Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu having warm humid temperate to tropical climate in the cropping
period. Lesions on the leaves elongated between the veins, tan with buff to
brown or dark reddish brown borders. Lesion size may vary in inbreds and
hybrids due to different genetic backgrounds. Growing of HM 10, PAU 352,
Malviya Hybrid Makka 2, EMH 1, HQPM 7, HQPM 5, HQPM 1, Shaktiman 3, Shaktiman
4, PEMH– 5, HQPM-4, and HSC-1 with need based sprays of mancozeb or zineb @
2.5g/litre of water. | ![Pest Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize12.png) | ![Pest
Maize](imagedefault/pestmaize13.png) \---|---|--- Common rust (Puccinia
sorghi) This rust attacks in the maize growing areas with subtropical
temperate and high land environment of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh,
Sikkim, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Punjab (Rabi), Haryana (Rabi), Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar (Rabi), Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. It appears at the time of tasseling. The circular to
elongate, golden brown to cinnamon brown pustules are visible over both leaf
surfaces changing to brownish black at plant maturity. Adopt promising
hybrids/ varieties viz.; Buland, Sheetal, HHM 1, HHM 2 and HQPM 1,
Nithyashree. Spray of mancozeb@ 2.5g/litre of water at first appearance of
pustules. Prefer early maturing varieties. * Home * About Us * Help * Weather

 Pest and Disease Management in Organic Ecosystem 
General  Immense commercialisation of agriculture has had a very negative 
effect on the environment. The use of pesticides has led to enormous levels 

of chemical buildup in our environment,
 in soil, water, air, in animals and 
even in our own bodies. Fertilisers have a short-term effect on productivity 

but a longer-term negative effect on 
the environment where they remain for 
years after leaching and running off, contaminating ground water and water 
bodies. The use of hybrid seeds and the practice of monoculture has led to a 
severe threat to local and indigenous varieties, whose germplasm can be lost 

for ever. All this for "productivity".  
 In the name of growing more to feed the earth, it has taken the 
wrong road of unsustainability. The effe
cts show - farmers committing suicide 
in growing numbers with every passing year; the horrendous effects of 

pesticide sprays,  pesticide contaminated bottled water and aerated 

beverages are only some instances. The bigger picture that rarely makes 

news however is that millions of people
 are still underfed, and where they do 
get enough to eat, the food
 they eat has the capability to eventually kill them. 
 Another negative effect of this trend has been on the fortunes of the 
farming communities worldwide. Despite 
this so-called increased productivity, 
farmers in practically every country ar
ound the world have seen a downturn 
in their fortunes. This is where organic farming comes in. Organic farming has 

the capability to take care of each 
of these problems. Besides the obvious 
immediate and positive effects organic or natural farming has on the 

environment and quality of food, it also 
greatly helps a farmer to become self-
sufficient in his requirements for ag
ro-inputs and reduce his costs.  
 Modern farming affects our world, by the way of land exhaustion, 
nitrate run off, soil erosion, soil comp
action, loss of cultivated biodiversity, 
habitat destruction, contaminated food and destruction of traditional 

knowledge systems and traditions. Thus to
 overcome the ill effects of modern 
agriculture, can be delineated by adopting organic farming.

 Modules in Organic Pest and Disease Management 
  Organic farming methods
 combine scientific knowledge of 
ecology and modern technology with tr
aditional farming practices based on 
naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied 

in the field of agroecology. While co
nventional agriculture uses synthetic 
pesticides and water-soluble syntheticall
y purified fertilizers, organic farmers 
are restricted by regulations to using 
natural pesticides and fertilizers. The 
principal methods of organic farming 
include crop rotation, green manures 
and compost, biological pest control,
 and mechanical cultivation. These 
measures use the natural environment to
 enhance agricultural productivity: 
legumes are planted to fix nitrogen into
 the soil, natural insect predators are 
encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural 

materials such as potassium bicarbon
ate and mulches are used to control 
disease and weeds. Organic farmers are careful in their selection of plant 

breeds, and organic researchers produce hardier plants through plant 

breeding rather than genetic engineering. 
 In intensive farming systems, organic agriculture decreases yield; 
the range depends on the intensity of ex
ternal input used before conversion. 
In the green revolution areas (irri
gated lands and well endowed water 
regions), conversion to organic agriculture usually leads to almost identical

 yields. In traditional rain fed agricult
ure (with low external inputs), organic 
agriculture has shown the potentials to
 increase yields. A number of studies 
have shown that under drought conditions, crops in organic agriculture 
systems produce significantly and sustai
nably higher yields than comparable 
conventional agricultural crops, often out-yielding conventional crops by 7 - 

90 per cent. Others have shown that organic systems have less long-term 

yield variability.    Codex Alimentarius Commission, a 
joint body of FAO/WHO defines
 ﬁorganic agriculture as holistic food production management systems, which 
promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, 
biological cycles and soil biological 
activity.  It emphasizes the use of 
management practices in preference to th
e use of off-farm inputs, taking into 
account that regional conditions requir
e locally adapted systems.  This is 
accomplished by using, where possible, 
agronomic, biological and mechanical 
methods, as opposed to using syntheti
c materials, to fulfil any specific 
function within the systemﬂ.    
Global View 
 The popularity of organic farmin
g is gradually increasing and now 
organic agriculture is practiced in almo
st all countries of the world, and its 
share of agricultural land and farms is
 growing. As per a recent report of 
International Federation of Organic Ag
riculture Movements (IFOAM) the total 
organically managed area is more th
an 24 million hectares world-wide. 
Organic farming is practiced in approx
imately 130 countries of the world and 
the area under organic management is continually growing. Although 

production of organic crops is increasing across the globe, sales are 

concentrated in the industrialized parts of the world. 
 In addition, the area of certified 
wild harvested plants is at least a 
further 10.7 million hectares, according 
to various certification bodies. The 
market for organic products is growing,
 not only in Europe and North America 
but also in many other countries. The global market for organic food has 

touched US$ 29 to 31 billions by 2005.  The demand for organic food is 

steadily increasing both in developed 
and developing countries, with annual 
average growth rate of 20-25%.  
Indian Status  Only 35% of India™s to
tal cultivable area is covered with fertilizers 
where irrigation facilities are availabl
e and in the remaining 65% of arable 
land, which is mainly rain-f
ed, negligible amount of fertilizers are being used.  
Farmers in these areas often use organic manure as a source of nutrients that 

are readily available either in their own 
farm or in their locality.  The north-
eastern region of India provides co
nsiderable scope and opportunity for 
organic farming due to least utilization of 
chemical inputs.  It is estimated that 
18 million hectare of such land is avai
lable in the North-East, which can be 
exploited for organic production.  Wit
h the sizable acreage under naturally 
organic/default organic cultivation, In
dia has tremendous potential to grow 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 crops organically and emerge as a major supplier of organic products in the 
world organic market.    
 The report of the Task Force on
 Organic Farming appointed by the 
Government of India also observed that
 in vast areas of the country, where 
limited amount of chemicals are used; productivity, could be exploited as 

potential areas for organic agriculture. 
 Arresting the decline of soil organic 
matter is the most potent weapon 
in fighting against unabated soil 
degradation and imperilled sustainability 
of agriculture in tropical regions of 
India, particularly those under the infl
uence of arid, semiarid and sub-humid 
climate.  Application of organic manure is the only option to improve the soil 

organic carbon for sustenance of so
il quality and future agricultural 
productivity.  Future of sustainable deve
lopment of agriculture, next to water, 
depends on arresting fall in organic matter in soils. 
Benefits of Organic Farming  Organic farming is beneficial fo
r both the humans and the nature. 
Some of the known benefits of organic farming are:  
 In organic farming, no fertilizers 
and pesticides are used, hence, no 
harmful synthetic chemicals rele
ased into the environment.   Organic farming improves productivi
ty of land by healing it with 
natural fertilizers.   Organic farms provide support to the diverse ecosystem by 
producing safe and healthy environment for humans, plants, insects 
and animals as well. 
  Organic farming is highly benefici
al for soil health. Due to the 
practices such as crop rotati
ons, inter-cropping, symbiotic 
associations, cover crops and minimum tillage, the soil erosion is 
decreased, which minimizes nut
rient losses and boosts soil 
productivity. The beneficial living 
organisms used in organic farming 
also help to improve the soil health. 
  It helps to promote sustainability by establishing an ecological 
balance. If organic farming techniques are used for long time, the 

farms tend to conserve energy and protect the environment by 

maintaining ecological harmony. 
  When calculated either per unit ar
ea or per unit of yield, organic 
farms use less energy and produce less waste.  
  Organic farming reduces groundwater pollution as no synthetic 
fertilizers and pesticides are used in this method.    Organic farming also helps to reduce the greenhouse effect and 
global warming because it has the 
ability to impound carbon in the 
soil.  Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  In organic farming method, same
 crop is not located in the
 farm, which encourages the build-up of diseases and pests that plague 
that particular crop.
  The central activity of organic farming relies on 
fertilization, pest 
and disease control. 
Organic farming relies heavily on the natural 
breakdown of organic matter, using techniques like green manure and 

composting, to replace nutrients taken fr
om the soil by previous crops. This 
biological process, driven by microorga
nisms such as mycorrhiza, allows the 
natural production of nutrients in the 
soil throughout the growing season, and 
has been referred to as 
feeding the soil to feed the plant.   Organic farming tends to tolerate 
some pest populations while taking 
a longer-term approach. Organic pest and disease control involves the 

cumulative effect of many techniques, including: 
 allowing for an acceptable level of pest and disease damage;  
 encouraging predatory beneficial
 insects to control pests;  
 encouraging beneficial microorganis
ms and insects; this by serving 
them nursery plants and/or an alte
rnative habitat, usually in a form 
of a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank  
 careful crop selection, choosing
 disease-resistant varieties  
 planting companion crops that discourage or divert pests;   using row covers to protect crops during pest migration periods;  
 using pest regulating plants and biologic pesticides, fungicides and 
herbicides   using no-till farming, and no-till farming techniques as false 
seedbeds  
 rotating crops to different locations from year to year to interrupt 
pest/disease reproduction cycles  Using insect traps to monitor and 
control insect populations that 
cause damage as well as transmit diseases.  
 Each of these techniques also provides other benefits viz., Soil 
protection and improvement, fertilizati
on, pollination, water conservation, 
season extension, etc.and these benefits are both complementary and 
cumulative in overall effect on farm he
alth. Effective organic pest and disease 
control requires a thorough understanding 
of pest life cycles and interactions. 
 Crop protection in organic agriculture is not a simple matter. It 
depends on a thorough knowledge of th
e crops grown and their likely pests, pathogens and weeds. Successful organic cr
op protection strategies also rely 
on an understanding of the effects which local climate, topography, soils and 

all aspects of the production system ar
e likely to have on crop performance 
and the possible host/pest complexes. Organic agriculture is rapidly 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 expanding and includes novel, edible, fibre and processing crops, diversified 
rotations and large scale stockless farming companies alongside traditional mixed organic farms. Many of the established strategies that have been 
developed to prevent and control weeds,
 pests and diseases in traditional 
organic systems have limited application 
in the more novel systems. Research 
is therefore urgently required to opti
mize these strategies for use in novel 
organic systems and necessary to develo
p new crop protection technologies, 
where pest, disease or weed problems are limiting expansion of the industry. 
 Pests/diseases are generally not a significant problem in organic 
systems, since healthy plants living in 
good soil with balanced nutrition are 
better able to resist pest/disease attack. However, major pest/disease 

damage is sometimes seen in organic 
crops, which are very susceptible to 
damage. Pest/disease problems can be pa
rticularly severe in large holdings, 
where several hectares of a single crop species may be grown. Pest/disease 
control strategies in organic farming sy
stems are mainly preventative rather 
than curative. The balance and management of cropped and uncropped 

areas, crop species and variety choice 
and the temporal and spatial pattern of 
the crop rotations used all aim to mainta
in a diverse population of beneficial 
organisms including competitors, parasites and predators of pests. Damaging 

populations of pests and pathogens are le
ss likely to establish in soils that 
sustain high levels of beneficial organisms. Break crop choice and rotation 

design can have a major impact on the incidence and severity of certain types 

of pest problems. The less mobile pests or those which have a specific or 

narrow host range are particularly suscep
tible to crop rotation. Highly mobile, 
often non-specific pests such as aphi
ds are less affected, or unaffected by 
rotation design. Reactive treatments 
for pest outbreaks, including natural 
pesticides, are permitted under regulations for specific situations in organic 

systems, but cultural pest prevention 
techniques including the use of break 
crops within balanced rotations will re
main the most important means for pest 
control in organic systems. 
Managing Pests and Diseases 
 Managing the ecosystem on an organic farm is very challenging.  It 
is made even more complex when factor
ing in insect and disease pests. Since 
the use of synthetic pesticides are prohibited, the organic cropping system 
should be focused on the 
prevention
 of pest outbreaks rather than coping 
with them after they occur. No single 
method is likely to be adequate for all 
pests. Successful pest management depends on the incorporation of a 
number of control strategies. Some strate
gies will target insect and disease 
separately and others wi
ll target them together. 
 Pests in a crop do not automatically 
result in damage or yield loss. In 
some instances, low levels of pest feed
ing have been shown to increase crop 
yields. Once infestation levels reach a certain point, however, they can 
produce economic losses. Thresholds vary with the crop and the pest in 
question and must be closely monitored by the producer. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Planning for effective insect and disease management must involve 
the entire farm operation and use all in
formation available. Any strategy in 
organic farming should include methods for: 
 insect and disease avoidance  
 managing the growth environment  
 direct treatment i. Avoidance Techniques 
 To manage pests and diseases effectively, producers need to 
understand the biology and growth habits of both pest and crop. The type 
and concentration of pests are often resp
onses to previous crop history, pest 
life cycles, soil conditions and local weather patterns. 
Crop Rotations  Crop rotation is central to all sustainable farming systems. It is an 
extremely effective way to minimize most pest problems while maintaining 
and enhancing soil structure and fertility. 
Diversity is the key to a successful cr
op rotation program.  It involves: 
 rotating early-seeded, late-seeded and fall-seeded crops  
 rotating between various crop types, such as annual, winter annual, 
perennial, grass and broadleaf crops; each of these plant groups has 
specific rooting habits, competitive abilities, nutrient and moisture 
requirements. (True diversity does not include different species 
within the same family - for exampl
e, wheat, oats and barley are all 
species of annual cereals.)  
 incorporating green manure crops, 
into the soil to suppress pests, 
disrupt their life cycles and to provid
e the additional benefits of fixing 
nitrogen and improving soil properties  
 managing the frequency with which a crop is grown within a rotation  
 maintaining the rotation's divers
ified habitat, which provides 
parasites and predators of pests with alternative sources of food, 
shelter and breeding sites  
 planting similar crop species as far 
apart as possible. Insects such as 
wheat midge and Colorado potato b
eetle, for example, are drawn to 
particular host crops and may over
winter in or near the previous 
host crops. With large distances 
to move to get to the successive 
crop, the insects' arrival may be delayed. The number that find the 
crop may be reduced as well.  
 Diverse rotations are particularly e
ffective in regulating flea beetles, 
cabbage butterfly, wheat midge, wheat st
em maggot and wheat stem sawfly.  
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Rotations are also effective in 
controlling soil- and stubble-borne 
diseases. The success of rotations in 
preventing disease depends on many 
factors, including the ability of a pathog
en to survive withou
t its host and the 
pathogen's host range. Those with a wi
de range of hosts will be controlled 
less successfully. For example, scleroti
nia stem-rot is a common disease in 
conventionally grown canola on the Prairi
es, but it can also infect at least a 
halfdozen other field crops. Rotations wi
ll not have much effect on pathogens 
that live indefinitely in the soil, but wi
ll shorten the life span
 of pathogens that 
can survive only brief periods apart from
 their hosts. Other situations that 
limit the benefit of crop rotations incl
ude: the transmission of pathogens via 
seed, the presence of susceptible weeds and volunteer crops that harbour 
pathogens, and the invasion of pathogens by wind and other means.  
 Rotations should be used with othe
r cultural practices to achieve the 
greatest benefit. 
Field Sanitation/Crop Residue Management
  Reducing or removing crop residu
es and alternate host sites can be 
used to control some insects and many
 diseases. Incorporating the residue 
into the soil hastens the destruction of
 disease pathogens by beneficial fungi 
and bacteria. Burying diseased plant mate
rial in this manner also reduces the 
movement of spores by wind.  Insects most affected by tillage wi
ll be those that overwinter in crop 
residue (for example, European corn 
borer and wheat stem sawfly) and those 
that lay their eggs in the residue. Co
nversely, fields where residue has not 
been disturbed may have higher levels of
 some beneficial predaceous insects, 
which may reduce levels of insect pe
sts such as root maggots in canola. 
Reduced or zero-tillage may also reduce
 the damage by certain pests, as the 
crop residue creates a micro-climate less preferred by some insects (for 
example, flea beetles).  
 It is important to maintain a ba
lance between crop sanitation and 
soil conservation. Lighter soils and th
ose prone to wind and water erosion 
may require postponing tillage until ju
st before seeding to ensure stubble 
cover for as long as possible.  Alternate host sites, such as fi
eld margins, fence lines, pastures, 
shelterbelts and riparian areas, wi
ll usually contain weeds and natural 
vegetation that may serve as reservoirs for disease, vectors of disease and 
insect pests. Left uncontrolled, these insect and disease pests can be 
transmitted to healthy crop plants. Insects may use these plants as alternate 
habitat until an appropriate crop occurs
 in a nearby field. However, these 
areas may also host many beneficial insects and predators, therefore the 
grower must carefully assess the potent
ial threat from pest insects in these 
areas before mowing or removing any plants. The ecological importance of 
areas such as sloughs, wooded bluffs, ro
ad allowances, railroad rights-of-way, 
abandoned farmyards and schoolyards must also be included in long-range 
planning. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 Seed Quality  The use of high-quality seed is especially important in preventing 
disease. The seed supply should be free of smut, ergot bodies or other 

sclerotia, and free of kernels showing 
symptoms of Fusarium head blight 
infection.  
 Seed analysis by a reputable seed testing laboratory will help 
determine specific diseases in the seed supply. 
 Relatively few diseases are exclusively seed-borne, and it is more 
common for pathogens to be transmitted from soil, stubble, or wind, as well 

as with the seed. 
 Planting physically sound seed is 
also important.  In crops such as 
flax, rye and pulses, a crack in the seed coat may serve as an entry point for 
soil-borne micro-organisms that rot the seed once it is planted.  
Weed Management  Although weeds need to be controll
ed to reduce their impact on crop 
yield and quality, a field completely fr
ee of weeds is not necessarily the best 
objective. In many cases, weeds prov
ide food and shelter for beneficial 
insects. Parasitic wasps, for example,
 are attracted to certain weeds with 
small flowers. Field experience has shown that the number of predators 
attacking insects increases and the 
number of aphids and leafhoppers 
decreases on certain crops as the diversity of weeds (that act as host plants) 
increases. Research has shown that outbreaks of certain crop insect pests are 
more likely in weed-free fields.  Insects that are generalist feeders,
 such as beet webworm, thistle 
caterpillars and grasshoppers, may prefer
 to feed on weeds rather than some 
crops, only damaging the crop after the weeds are eaten. 
 Each field situation should be considered separately, as weed 
competition must always be taken into
 account. Sometimes mowing weeds at 
the edge of the field results in beneficial organisms moving into the crop 
where they are needed. 
Forecasting  Producers should pay attention to 
the forecasts for various pest and 
disease infestations for each crop year. Maps of these forecasts are usually 
available for many of the major destruct
ive insects such as grasshoppers and 
wheat midge, as well as some diseases
. Agro meteorological warning and 
forecast can help in this way. Record-Keeping
  Keeping diligent field records can provide very useful information. A 
complete history of each field shou
ld include any insect or disease 
infestations, which management methods worked and which did not, and a 
list of management techniques to try in the future. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 ii. Managing the Growth Environmen
t - Giving the Crop a Head Start  Any crop management technique 
that contributes to a vigorous, 
competitive crop is a tool of insect and disease management. Producers must 
also be mindful that many practices th
at work well in conventional systems 
may not benefit organic systems. Certai
n crop species, crop varieties and 
equipment may work well in one system but not in the other. 
Healthy Soil  Maintaining favorable soil condit
ions is the first line of defense 
against pests. A biologically active soil
 with good drainage supports vigorous 
crop growth, allowing a higher level of crop competition with weeds.  
 Adequate, balanced soil nutrition is
 essential for crop quality, yield 
and moisture-use efficiency. The applicat
ion of nutrients should be based on a 
sound soil testing program, accompan
ied by plant tissue analysis when 
diagnosing problems. High levels of nitrogen can occur after a high-nitrogen 
plowdown, such as sweet clover. This re
sults in lush leaf tissue and a dense 
plant canopy that provides an idea
l environment for plant pathogens. However, a lush crop may also help disperse the damage by a given number 
of insects, so astute observations by the producer are necessary at all times. 
 In contrast, inadequate soil phos
phorous can pre-dispose to certain 
root diseases. Low levels of nitrogen can reduce the incidence of insect 
outbreaks. A shortage of micronutrients 
such as zinc or copper can result in 
disease-like symptoms on crops, while too much of any one micronutrient 
may be toxic.  The addition of composted livestock manure improves soil quality, 
including increasing the population of 
soil micro-organisms that compete with 
soil-borne plant pathogens. 
 Field experience has also shown th
at plants fertilized by the slow 
release of nutrients from compost are more resistant to insects and diseases 
than crops fertilized by highly solu
ble nutrients. Soil testing becomes 
important when applying compost regula
rly. An imbalance of nutrients can 
easily occur if the soil's nutrient profile is not continuously monitored. 
Crop and Variety Selection
  Producer awareness of insects and diseases in the proximity of the 
farm is very important and should infl
uence the crop and the variety of crop 
to be grown. These choices must also fi
t in with the crop rotation plan that 
has been developed. Some insect pests ar
e specific to certain crops, such as 
wheat stem sawfly, while ot
hers, such as grasshoppers, will attack numerous 
crops. The situation is similar with diseases. 
  The selection of insect- and disease-resistant cultivars can be a 
useful tool, but under no circumstances 
can genetically modified varieties be 
used in organic systems.  Wheat variet
ies with solid stems are more resistant 
to wheat stem sawfly than hollow-ste
mmed varieties. Wheat varieties with 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 resistance to wheat midge have been developed and should soon be 
available. These insect-resistant 
varieties were developed through 
conventional plant breeding programs. Certain species may avoid diseases 
such as Fusarium head blight, but often agronomic factors, such as time of 
seeding or choosing winter versus spring wheat, have more of an influence on 
the incidence of disease.  Plants also vary in their degree of attractiveness to insects, diseases 
and vectors transmitting disease. Factor
s such as leaf and stem toughness, 
pubescence, nutrient content, plant arch
itecture, growth habit and differences 
in maturity between crops and vari
eties can influence pest growth, 
reproduction and host preference. Fo
r example, earlier-maturing crop 
varieties may be less attractive to migr
ating populations of grasshoppers late 
in the season compared to later-maturing varieties. 
Intercropping
  The practice of intercropping (where two crops are grown at the 
same time) can reduce pest problems by making it more difficult for the pests 
to find a host crop. This technique 
also provides habitat for beneficial 
organisms. Strip-cropping row crops wi
th perennial legumes often leads to 
better pest control. In particular, alfa
lfa attracts many beneficial organisms 
that can destroy insect pests in neighbouring crops. 
Seeding Date  Planting should be scheduled so that the most susceptible time of 
plant growth does not correspond to th
e peak in pest cycles. Early seeding 
reduces crop damage caused by grasshoppers, aphids in cereal crops, wheat 
midge in spring wheat, barley yellow
 dwarf virus in barley and wheat, 
powdery mildew in peas and pasmo in flax. 
 Delayed seeding can be effective in avoiding wireworms and 
cutworms in cereal crops, Hessian fly in winter wheat, barley thrips, 
Ascochyta in lentils and wheat streak mo
saic virus in winter wheat. However, 
experience on the Prairies has generally
 shown that delaying seeding too long 
can reduce a crop's potential yield. 
Seeding Rate  Using a higher seeding rate to affect insect or disease infestations 
may have different results. More plants 
in a field may reduce the impact of a 
given aphid population on individual plants, but they may create a more 
favourable habitat for insects that prefer a dense canopy, such as true 
armyworm. A dense leaf canopy can also create a moist soil surface and 
elevated humidity within the crop, conditions favourable to certain leaf 
disease pathogens. 
 Reducing the seeding rate may decr
ease the severity of take-all in 
spring wheat, but the reduced canopy 
may also allow weeds to invade. In 
other crops, reduced seeding may also produce more insect damage, as in 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 the case of aphids, flea beetles and leafhoppers, which are attracted to the 
contrast between a green host
 and a dark soil background. 
Depth and Timing of Seeding
  Optimum seeding depth is also impo
rtant. Deep seeding in cold soils 
may result in seedling blights and dampin
g-off, especially in pulses and small-
seeded crops. Seeding depth should gene
rally be no deeper than required for 
quick germination and even emergence. Variables include seed size, soil type 
and moisture conditions. If the soil 
is loose before seeding, a packing 
operation will firm up the soil and br
ing moisture closer to the surface. 
 For most crops, seeding should ideally be done when the soil is 
warm enough for rapid germination. S
eeds that remain ungerminated in cool 
soil are more susceptible to damage
 by insects such as wireworms. 
Trap Strips  Seeding trap strips around the edge of a cropped field or along a 
fence row helps lure insect pests to a specific area where they can be 
managed more easily. For example, planting bromegrass near a wheat field 
attracts wheat stem sawflies and their 
native parasites away from the wheat 
crop. Similarly, a trap strip of potato
es planted much earlier than the main 
crop would attract Colorado potato b
eetles to the area. The strip could be 
worked under along with the adult beetles, eggs and larvae before the second 
generation of beetles spreads to the main crop. 
 Generally, the insect pests in the trap strips are controlled by 
mowing or cultivating the strip, or by 
applying an acceptable organic product, 
such as 
Bacillus thuringiensis
. Trap strips can also act as a barrier to protect 
the crop field. Producers have found that planting yellow sweet clover or 
Sirius field peas repels grasshoppers and prevents them from damaging 
crops. A thorough knowledge of the crop and insect pests of the area is 
necessary to prevent this technique from backfiring. 
Tillage  Tillage can be properly timed before seeding, after harvesting and 
during summerfallow to reduce population
s of insect pests such as cutworms 
and grasshoppers that spend part of thei
r life cycles in the soil or stubble. 
Tillage can help starve insects in the sp
ring or during fallow, prevent adults 
from laying eggs in the soil and expose overwintering insects to predators and 
inclement weather. Roguing  Roguing refers to the labour-intensi
ve practice of walking the fields 
to remove diseased or insect-infested 
plants. Roguing may not be practical for 
large fields, but could be suitable for seed plots or crops having highly 
infectious and destructive diseases (f
or example, bacterial blackleg in 
potatoes and certain viruses in other crops).  
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 iii. Direct Treatment 
 At times, the organic producer will find that, despite all the best 
efforts, an insect or disease pest will grow to levels that cause substantial 
crop damage. At this point, direct treatment may be necessary. 
Monitoring  Insect monitoring traps are useful in determining which insect pests 
are present in a field and whether they 
are at economically important levels. 
It is imperative that the producer has a 
positive identification of the insect or 
disease causing damage before choosing a method of treatment.  
 Certain types of insect hormones called pheromones may be used as 
attractants to monitor population levels
 of insects such as bertha armyworm, 
diamondback moth, cabbage looper and Eu
ropean corn borer, or to simply 
attract insects into a trap. Biological Control
  In a healthy, balanced ecosystem, biological control by natural 
predators is constantly occurring. The more diverse a cropping system 
becomes, the greater the spectrum of
 insect species and micro-organisms 
within it. This leads to the developmen
t of more natural predators within the 
ecosystem.   Ladybugs, ambush bugs, hoverfly 
larvae, lacewings, spiders, birds, 
frogs, toads and a host of other insects are predators of aphids, bertha 
armyworm larvae, sunflower beetles, 
beet webworms, and both grasshopper 
eggs and adults. The destructive wheat mi
dge may also be partially controlled 
by a parasitic wasp, but crop
 damage may still occur. 
 Various types of fungi are insect 
parasites and can either kill their 
insect hosts or reduce their ability to reproduce. Very few biological controls 
are available to reduce the effects of
 plant diseases, as most commercial 
products do not perform well if the disease is already established in the crop. 
Mycoparasitism is a form of bio-contro
l where one fungus parasitizes another. 
Although this process occurs with many
 fungi under laboratory conditions, it 
hasn't been successful under field conditions. 
Natural Insecticides
  Organic certification standards prohibit the use of synthetic 
pesticides. Permitted disease-manageme
nt products include copper (fixed 
copper and copper sulphate), lime-sulphur mixes, elemental sulphur, vinegar, 
soap and silica. Bordeaux mixture is co
nsidered a restricted substance, and 
farmers should contact their certifying 
body before using it. Although these 
products are allowed, it may not be cost
-effective or feasible to apply them to 
field crops. Scientific evidence on pr
oduct efficacy should be researched 
before using them.  Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  The high risk of phytotoxicity should also be considered when using 
these products on certain plants; ofte
n the margin of error between benefit 
and damage to the plant is very small.
 In addition, there are environmental 
and ecological concerns surrounding some of these products. Additional soil 

tests may be required to monitor coppe
r and sulphur levels in the soil. As 
well, organic certification may be denied to farms that overuse or depend on 

such products.   Insecticides permitted in organic agriculture include some microbial 
insecticides containing the bacteria 
Bacillus thuringiensis
. Three main strains 
of these bacteria are used in insect co
ntrol. One strain, marketed as Dipel or 
Thuricide, kills only th
e larvae of moths or bu
tterflies. Another strain, 
marketed as Novodor, is for beetle larvae only and can be used to control 

Colorado potato beetles. The third strain
 is specifically for mosquito and fly 
larvae.   Botanical insecticides, such as rotenone, are also permitted in 
organic agriculture, but they are often too expensive to use on large 
acreages.  Other Control Methods  For pest control, beneficial orga
nisms, dormant oil, diatomaceous 
earth, plant-derived pesticides, soap, na
tural and synthetic insect pheromones 
which disrupt the insect's developmen
t, and commercial insect vacuums can 
be used.  
Grain Storage  When stored grain is dry and its temperature is low, problems 
seldom arise. But if the grain is warm and moist, insects and fungi can 
multiply rapidly. A grain temperature of
 5°C to 10°C is adequate for long-term 
storage. Bin aeration helps dry and cool
 the grain. If bins are not equipped 
with aeration systems, grain can be mo
ved to cool it. Cold temperatures can 
be used to control insects that exist in stored grain.  
 Before storing new grain, the bin 
should be thoroughly cleaned with 
a grain vacuum. The empty bin can be treated with diatomaceous earth to 
control stored-grain insects. Many organic producers have found it to be 
effective when applied as a light coatin
g on the floor of the bin, and around 
the walls and the bin door. It can also be added to the grain as it is being 
brought into storage.   Natural products for Pest Control

All-round Herbal Pesticide 
 Herbal extracts should be used only as a final remedy only after 
utilizing & practicing all the above said
 methods. One should try to use only 
the locally available weeds or those that
 are grown as life fence for making 
herbal extracts. If enough materials 
are not available in and around the 
garden, then materials can be collected fr
om other areas. To be self sufficient 
it is better to develop the herbal plant resources by raising them as hedges 

along the fence, in the waste areas like
 slopes, gullies, & rocky patches and 
along the path. 
Basic important procedures to be followed while preparing the herbal extracts 
are:   Macerate and grind the plant material 
to a pulp state. This is mainly 
to expose the cells and facilitate the 
extraction of the active principle 
with the help of water.  Soak the pulped material in at least 70-80% of the final volume of 
spray solution.  Since the water has a limited disso
lving capacity, with low volume 
the extraction will not be full.  Soak the pulped material only for 3-
5 days. If it is allowed to ferment 
for more number of days the active principles from the herbs that 
are needed to kill the insects will disintegrate into simpler harmless 

component. 
 After 3 - 5 days of fermentation
, the whole solution should be 
filtered and the final spray volume
 should be made by adding the 
balance water.  Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  The filtered final solution has to 
be sprayed in such a way that the 
whole plant is fully drenched at le
ast one or two times in a year.  
 To avoid soaking for 3-4 days, soak
 it at least overnight and then 
heat it to bearable warmth (60-70°C) for an hour by stirring. After 

this dilute it to the required fina
l volume of spray solution, filter, 
allow cooling and spraying.  
 Use at least 2-3 different materials 
at a time to prepare the herbal 
extract.  Change the combination of the materials every time.  
 Use 2-3% of herbal extract (combination of 2-3 different materials) 
while the pest attack is at early st
age. Increase the dosage to 5-6% 
if the attack is very severe.  
 The first two sprays in a season should by a blanket spray, on 
observing the attack.

Pest/Disease Management Packages for Different Crops 
Integrated Pest Management package for Organic Rice Ecosystem 
 Rice is essentially a crop of warm, humid environments conducive to 
the survival and Proliferation of insect
s. More than 70 species were recorded 
as pests of rice and about 20 have ma
jor significance. Together, they infest 
all parts of the plant at all growth stag
es. The insects act as vectors of virus 
diseases, and are a major factor responsibl
e for low rice yields particularly in 
Tropical Asia, the world™s rice bowl. The 
insect problem is accentuated in multi 
cropping or dormancy but occurs th
roughout the year in over lapping 
generations. The yield losses vary from
 20 to 50 per cent due to the damage 
caused by various insect Pests. 
 Mechanical control methods  Collection and destruction of rice st
ubbles from field after harvest as 
they harbour egg, larvae, pupae of 
stem borer, gall midge, white tip 
nematode and root knot nematodes.  
 Clipping the tips of the seedlings up
 to 2 inches prior to transplanting 
to remove the egg masses of stem borer if any. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Collection of egg masses of stem borer and silver shoots from the 
nursery seedlings.  Flooding the nursery to make the hiding
 larvae in the soil to come to 
the surface and thus they are picked by the birds (army worm) 
 A rope may be passed over the young
 crop for dislodging the larval 
cases from the tillers and then the water should be drained for 
eliminating them (case worm). 
 Providing bird perches of 2-3 ft height in vegetative stage @ 15-20 / 
acre. They should be removed after seed setting to avoid the bird 
damage to seeds. Drinking pots 
with water should be provided 
around the perches. 
 Collection and destruction of egg masses of stem borer and ear head 
bugs in main field. 
 A thorny hedge may be passed over the crop when it is affected by 
leaf folder to unfold the leaf folds 
and to expose the larvae within to 
natural enemies and botanical sprays. 
Cultural control methods  Avoid close planting especially in 
BPH and leaf folder prone areas or 
seasons.   For every 5-6 m leave a spacing of 75 cm (hoppers). 
 Grow horse gram, green gram, soy bean on bunds to attract natural 
enemies.   Controlled irrigation by in
termittent draining (BPH). 
 Remove the weeds on bunds that ha
rbour BPH, gall midge, GLH, leaf 
folder, ear head bug. Biological control methods 
 The crop should be observed from 20 DAT and when stem borer 
eggs are observed on leaf tips and leaf folder eggs on veins, release 
Trichogramma chilonis
 (for leaf folder) and 
T. japonicum
 (for stem 
borer) thrice @ 1,00,000/ha each and spray

 @ 
1.0 kg/ha when the stem borer / leaf folder crosses ETL. 
 Release Platygaster oryzae parasitized galls @ 1 per 10 m
2 on 10 
days after transplanting (DAT) (gall midge). 
Botanical control methods 
 Spray neem seed kernel extract, neem oil, pungam oil (5%) on need 
base at 15 days interval. Teepol or soap solution should be mixed at 
2 ml / litre (general). 
 Apply  Acorus calamus killikulam dust @ 10 kg / ac (ear head bug).

 Integrated Pest/Disease Management Package for Organic Cotton 
Ecosystem 
 Cotton, the most important fibre cr
op of India plays a dominant role 
in its agrarian and industrial economy.
 It is the backbone of our textile 
industry, accounting for 70% of total fi
bre consumption in textile sector, and 
38% of the country's export, fetching over Rs. 42,000 crores. Area under 

cotton cultivation in India (8.9 million 
ha) is the highest in the world, i.e., 
25% of the world area and employs se
ven million people for their living. 
 Cotton productivity in India is 
quite low as compared to world 
standards. The modern cotton production
 technology relies heavily on the use 
of fertilizers and on chemicals to cont
rol insect pests, diseases, weeds and 
growth regulators. Cotton 
cultivated on 5% cultivable land consumes 54% of 
total pesticides used in Indian agricult
ure, and in some pockets, the rates are 
higher than this, leaving immense ecological and human hazards as reported 

by World Health Organization. Use of ch
emicals at such scale causes a lot of 
hazards to man, i.e., environmental po
llution, soil health, and agro-ecology 
and poor profitability in cotton farm
ing. This has basically prompted the 
demand of organically cultivated, eco-friendly or ‚green™ cotton.  
Mechanical control methods  Removal and destruction of crop re
sidues after harvest to avoid the 
carry over population of American
 boll worm to next season.  
 Removal of terminals of cotton crop (topping) at 80-90 days of 
growth to reduce 
Helicoverpa oviposition and also to encourage 
sympodial branching which bears more fruiting bodies. 
 Removal and destruction of alternat
e weed hosts of white fly like 
Abutilon indicum
, Chrozophore rottlari, Solanum nigrum 
and 
Hibiscus 
ficulensus from the fields and neighbouring areas and maintaining 
field sanitation.  Collection and destruction of leaves infested with white fly  
 Hand picking and burning of th

 Vegetables being a rich and cheap source of vitamins and minerals, 
occupy an important place in the food
 basket of Indian consumers. The 
country is producing about 98 million tonnes (MT) of vegetables from an area 

of around 6.07 million ha. Not withstanding the advantages of vegetables, 

farmers confront a number of problems pa
rticularly of insect pests, diseases, 
nematodes and mites which limit their 
production. Among the vegetable crops 
okra, brinjal, tomato, cabbage and ca
uliflower are important and together 
occupy an area of 1.65 m ha with an annual production of 22.17 MT and they 

are infested by several pests at various stages resulting in a yield loss of 
about 25-30%. Pest management is thus
 important with a view to reduce 
undesired use of pesticides.

Beauveria bassiana Tomato Diseases and their management 
 Tomato diseases are rarely fatal, if the proper management is 
employed. It is important to catch any to
mato disease early, before it spreads 
to all of tomato plants and possibly othe
r plants in the same family, such as 
potatoes, eggplants and peppers. Here
 are some common tomato diseases 
and their management.  
Early Blight
: Early Blight fungus overwinters in plant residue and is soil-
borne. It can also come in on transplants. Remove affected plants and 
thoroughly clean fall garden debris. Wet 
weather and stressed plants increase 
likelihood of attack. Copper sprays ca
n prevent further development of the 
fungus.  
Gray Leaf Spot: 
Gray Leaf Spot affects only th
e leaves of tomatoes, starting 
with the oldest leaves. Warm, moist 
conditions worsen gray leaf spot 
problems. Remove all affected plants and fall garden debris. Selection of 
resistant varieties prevents the disease infection. 
Late Blight:
 Late blight affects both the leaves and fruit of tomatoes. Late 
Blight is the disease responsible for the Irish Potato Famine. The Late Blight 
fungus can overwinter in frost free areas. Cool, wet weather encourages the 
development of the fungus. 
Septoria Leaf Spot:
 Septoria Leaf Spot is sometimes mistaken for Late 
Blight. With septoria leaf spot, the pape
ry patches on the leaves develop tiny, 
dark specks inside them. Older leaves are affected first. Copper sprays are 
somewhat affective at halting the spread of symptoms.  
Verticillium Wilt:
 This name can be misleading, as sometimes the leaves 
will turn yellow, dry up and never appear to wilt. Verticillium wilt is caused by 
a soil-borne fungus and it can affect many different vegetables. The fungus 
can persist in the soil for many years,
 so crop rotation and selection of 
resistant varieties is crucial. Remove affected plants and choose resistant 
varieties.  Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem

Cercospora Leaf Spots: Cercospora malayensis
 C. abelmoschi Fusarium Wilt Of Okra: Fusarium vasinfectum 
Powdery Mildew: Erysiphe cichoracearum and  
Vein-Clearing/Yellow Vein Mosaic  
Management  Once the disease becomes destructive,
 it is advisable to find clean 
fields even if such a plan involves renting additional land.  
 A better plan is to use a 6-year rotation before the fungus is 
destructive; this permit many ye
ars of okra growing without too 
much loss.   For sowing during the summer season
, when the whitefly activity is 
high, the susceptible varieties should be avoided.  
 By selecting varieties resistant to 
yellow vein mosaic like Parbhani 
Kranti, Arka Abhay, Arka Anamika, Co3, and Varsha Uphar, the 
incidence of the disease can be minimised.  
 Even in these varieties, when a pl
ant starts exhibiting symptom of 
the disease, it should be pulled 
out immediately and burnt by which 
the spread of the diseases can be prevented.

 Eco-Friendly Methods for Stored Grain/Seed Insect Management 
 Ever since the advent of stabilized Agriculture, storage of produce 
has remained an issue of utmost concern. Unless the problem of storage is 

solved satisfactorily the problem of hung
ry millions may continue even with 
substantial increase in production. Th
ere are a number of estimates of post 
harvest losses. Most conservative estima
tes for the post harvest losses in food 
grains in India even put at about 10%, 
a quantity good enough to feed at 
least 60 million people. Out of the tota
l production, about 70% is retained 
and stored by farmers for consumption,
 as seed, feed and payment of wages 
and only about 30% is marketable su
rplus. Insects are responsible for 
enormous spoilage in storage they feed 
on grain, bore the kernel, and destroy 
the germ portion, cause heating and dete
rioration in stored produce. As per 
the Pause committee report, the storage losses due to insect pests of stored 

grain are 2.55%. In addition they are 
also responsible for the qualitative 
losses in food grains.  
Sources of Infection 
 Field infestation, insects fly from st
ores to fields and lay eggs upon 
the maturing grains.   These eggs hatch out to larvae in favourable conditions when grains 
reach the stores. They can crawl/fly to fresh stocks and infest them 
is called cross infestation.  
 It has been a general practices, sp
ecially with farmers, that they 
keep without cleaning the empty food grain bags for use in the next 
season only.  
 Eggs and larvae of insects rema
in hidden and feed on the grain 
fragments in the off season. Whenever the grains are filled up in 
such bags, infestation reappears.  
 The insects, which may be present 
in the joints or corners of the 
carriers, migrate to the food grai
n lots and cause infestation.  
 The scientific storage of grains helps in minimizing the damage by 
insects, and microorganisms.  
 The following methods can help in safe storage of grains. 
 Preventive measures  
 Curative measures  
Preventive measures Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Cleaning the storage structures, sealing of cracks, crevices and holes 
present in the floors. Cleaning of the Sheller before their use.  
 Storage structures/godowns/gunny bags should be disinfected with 
approved residual insecticides pr
eferably with Malathion 50% EC, 
with dilution 1 : 100.  
 Proper stacking of the filled bags
 for proper hygiene and sanitation 
prevents insect damage in the godowns.  
Curative measures  
The infestation of stored grain insect
 pests can be minimized by different 
methods Physical control measures 
 Heat treatment of stored grain at 55-60°C  
 Mixing of inert dusts with grain ma
kes entry of insects a difficult 
task. However here grain has to be washed before consumption.  
Mechanical measures  These measures are practicable and include sieving of grains.  
Ecological measures 
 Temperature, moisture content of 
grain and availability of oxygen 
have to be suitably manipulated by designing and constructing the 
storage structures which create unfavourable ecological conditions 

for insect attack.   Food grains kept in airtight sealed structure remain insect free. Eg. 
Pusa bin.  
 Grains with moisture content less than 10% are not suitable for 
multiplication and survival of mo
st of the insects (except Khapra 
beetle which can survive but it is susceptible to reduced oxygen 

content)  
 Apart from this TNAU have developed various ecofriendly techniques 
for controlling stored products and are given below. 
i. TNAU Insect Probe Trap 
 
 The use of trap is relatively a new method of 
detecting trapping insects in stored grains. The basic 

component of a TNAU probe trap consists of three 
important parts: A main tube, 
insect trapping tube and a 
detachable cone at the bottom. Equispaced perforations of 

2 mm diameter are made in the main tube. 
 Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 Concept 
 Insects love ﬁAIRﬂ and move towards air. This behaviour of the 
insect is exploited in this technology. 
 Method of working 
 The insect trap has to be kept in the grain like rice, wheat etc., 
vertically with the white plastic cone 
downside as shown the figure. The top 
red cap must be with the level of the gr
ain. Insects will move towards air in 
the main tube and enter through the hole
. Once the insect enters the hole it 
falls down into the detachable white co
ne at the bottom. Then there is no 
way to escape and the insects are tr
apped forever. The white detachable 
cone can be unscrewed once in a week
 and the insects can be destroyed. 
Salient Features 
 No chemicals; No side effects and No maintenance cost. 
Significance 
 Commercialized during 2002. Around
 1, 00,000 units have been sold 
so far across the country. The trap has been included for 
popularization under Canadian International Development Agency 

(CIDA) and Mc Gill University Project on "
Food Security in South 
India" 
at TNAU, Coimbatore and UAS 
(University of Agricultural 
Sciences), Dharwad during 2003-2007.  
 CARE (Co-operative for Assist
ance and Belief Everywhere) 
world's largest independent, non profit, nonsectarian, non 
government international relief an
d development organization with 
its internal secretariat at Brussels, Belgium is using the TNAU probe 

trap technology under integrated child development services in 

Madhya Pradesh. 
 Won Best Creative product award from Chamber of Commerce, 
South India, 2002. 
Recent achievements 
 A good response from tribal region
s of Adilabad district of Andhra 
Pradesh for the trap. Women are purchasing the trap and using 
them to control insects in rice / 
sorghum. They say that the traps are 
useful in reducing the drudgery of cleaning their grains through 

frequent sieving. 
 Recently M/s. TATA Chemicals Ltd., Kolkatta has taken up marketing 
of TNAU probe trap, through TATA Kissan Sanchar in Gorakpur area 

of Uttar Pradesh after detailed field studies independently by them. 
 Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 Efficiency 
 TNAU Insect traps are excellent insect detection devices in food 
grains and more effective in the detection of stored grain insects namely 
Rhyzopertha dominica 
(F.), 
Sitophilus cryzae 
(L.) and 
Tribolium castaneum 
(Herbst) in stored food grains both 
in terms of detection 
as well as 
number of insects caught 
than the standard normal sampling method (by 
spear sampling). The detection ratio (trap 
: normal sample) is higher in trap 
than of normal sampling method by fa
ctors ranging from 2 : 1 to 31:1. The 
insects catch is also higher in the 
probe trap than the normal sampling 
method by factors ranging from 20: 1 to 121: 1. 
 They are also good mass trapping devices when used at 2 - 3 
numbers / 25 kg bin (28 cm dia and 39 cm length). They should be placed at 

top 6 inches of the grain, where the insect
 activity is seen during early period 
of storage. They can remove > 80% 
of the insects within 10 - 20 days. 
ii. TNAU Pit Fall Trap
 Pitfall traps are used for capturing insects active on grain surface and in other 
layers of grain (Monitorin
g and mass trapping tool). Standard Model
  Standard model of pitfall trap has 2 
parts, perforated lid (2 mm (or) 3 
mm) and a cone shaped bottom 

portion.  Application of special coating with 
sticky material on the inner side of 
cone to hold trapped insects is 
necessary 
 This procedure is tedious. 
TNAU Model
  TNAU model has perforated lid, cone 
shaped bottom which tapers into a 
funnel shaped trapping tube. 
 Hence sticky coating is dispensed 
with  Commercial model is in plastic, 
simple and economical. 
 Easy to handle. 
Significance
 Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Commercialized very recently 
and product launched on 18 
September 2006 by TNAU and available in food grade plastic 
materials.  Cost is only Rs.25/-  Around 1000 units have been distribu
ted to KVK's for popularization 
of the technology  Because of easy handling and low cost, there is great scope of this 
model to spread fast across the country.  No such cost effective and durable 
device is available so far in any 
part of the world. Twenty five Rupees investment will be worth to 
collect plenty of stored grain insects. iii. TNAU Two-In-One Model Trap 
The probe trap containing the components namely the 
perforated tube, pitfall me
chanism, a collection tube 
and the cone shaped pitfall trap with a perforated lid 

and the bottom tapering cone were combined as a 

single unit. Combination of probe and pitfall increase 

the trapping efficiency of insects. Best suited for pulse 

beetles as they are seen only on grain surface 

wandering here and there. It does not require tedious 

procedures like coating the inner surface of pitfall cone 

with sticky materials before trapping to hold pulse 

beetles. Beetles are captured alive in this trap, which 

may facilitate release of pheromone and there by 
attract more insects. Significance
  Commercialised and commercial launc
hing was held on 30.12.2003. 
 Around 100-200 used of farmers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka units 
have been dispatched to UAS, Dharwad for popularisation 
 This trap technology is one of the promising technologies 
commercialised under National Ag
ricultural Technology Project 
funded by World Bank (Rainfed eco 

system)  Spreading fast across the country. 
iv. Indicator Device 
It consists of a cone shaped perforated cup 
(3mm perforation) with a lid at the top. The cup 

is fixed at the bottom with a container and 

circular dish, which are to be smeared with 

sticky material like vaseline.  Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Farmers, before storing their puls
es, should take 200 g of pulses to 
be stored and put them in the cup. Wh
en the field carried over beetles start 
emerging, due to their wandering behavi
our, they enter the perforations and 
get slipped off and fall into the trappi
ng portions. As they stick on to the 
sticky materials, farmers can easily lo
cate the beetles and can take out the 
bulk-stored pulses for sun drying.  The 
device with 2mm perforations can be 
used for cereals. This will help in elim
inating the initial po
pulation, which acts 
as the major source for further build up
. Thus, timely detection will help the 
farmers to preserve their valuable pulses during storage. The device is being 

popularised. v. TNAU Automatic Insect Removal Bin 
 TNAU insect removal bin can remove insect 
automatically. The structure has 4 major parts 

namely outer container, inner perforated container, 

collection vessel and the lid. The model exploits 

wandering behaviour of stored product insects as 

well as the movement of these insects towards well 

aerated regions. The grains are held in the specially 

designed inner perforated container. The space 

between inner and outer container provides good 

aeration for the insects. Insects, while wandering, 

enter the perforation to reach the aerated part and while doing so, get slipped 

off and fall into the collection vessel th
rough a pitfall mechanism provided in 
the collection vessel. In order to quickly 
collect the insects, as and when they 
emerge from grains, perforated (2 mm) rods are fixed in the inner container. 
 The container will be useful for st
oring rice, wheat, broken pulses, 
coriander etc. The insects such as rice
 weevil, lesser grain borer, red flour 
beetle, saw toothed beetle, which are commonly found attacking stored 

grains can be removed automatically by storing grains in this container. 

Within a very short period of 10 days a majority of the insects (more than 90 

per cent) can be removed from the grains. The containers are available in 2 

kg, 5 kg, 25 kg, 100 kg and 500 kg capacities. 
Efficiency 
 Grains (paddy and sorghum) stored in Automatic insect removal bin 
(100 kg and 500 kg) recorded only 1 - 4% damage by insects compared to 33 

to 65% damage in ordinary bin after 10 
months of storage. The population of 
insects (R. dominica,  S. oryzae) 
ranged from 0 - 2/kg in grain stored in 100 
kg Automatic insect removal bin compared to 5 - 191 / kg in ordinary bin after 10 months of storage. 
Significance 
 The technology was popularised of the Avinashilingam deemed 
University through a project from Department Science and 
Technology, Government of India. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Tamil Nadu State Council for Scie
nce and Technology sanction Rs. 
10,000 during 1998 for popularisation
 of Gadgets to women folk. 
 Suitability for developing countries
  No granaries can be filled with grains 
without insects
 as the 
harvested produce contain, egg (or) la
rvae (or) pupae in them because of 
'field carryover infestation' which canno
t be avoided in developing countries 
like India (known scientific fact). 
 So the aim of stored product insect researcher should target on this 
field carryover population (which is ge
nerally < 1%) which emerge has adults 
15 to 20 days after harvest in granaries. 
 In this field carryover population 
is not cared then the insect will 
multiply and contaminate the food grai
ns and complete damage can even be 
expected within 4 months of storage. 
 Here comes the role of 
automatic insect removal bin
 which can 
remove substantial number of emerging adults and sometimes free living 

larvae also.  Significant achievements have happe
ned in popularization of Automatic 
Insect Removal bin Technology. 
vi. UV - Light Trap for Grain Storage Godowns 
The UV light trap mainly consists of 
a ultra-violet source (4 W germicidal 

lamps). The lamp produces ultra-

violet rays of peak emission around 

250 nano meter. The light is fitted at 

the centre of a funnel of 310 mm 

diameter at the top and 35 mm 

diameter at the bottom. The bottom 

end of the funnel is attached with a 

transparent plastic container for 

collecting the trapped insects. To 

hang the unit at desired points, 
three hooks have been provided at the pe
riphery of the funnel. The unit is also 
provided with a tripod stand.  The UV light trap can be placed in food grain storage godowns at 1.5 
m above ground level, preferably in pl
aces around warehouse corners, as it 
has been observed that the insect tend
s to move towards these places during 
the evening hours. The trap can be operated during the night hours. The light 

trap attracts stored product insects of paddy like lesser grain borer, 
Rhyzopertha dominica, red flour beetle, 
Tribolium castaneum and saw 
toothed beetle, 
Oryzaephilus surnamensis 
in large numbers. Psocids which are 
of great nuisance in godowns are also 
attracted in large numbers. Normally 2 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 numbers of UV light trap per 60 x 20 m (L x B) godown with 5 m height is 
suggested.  The trap is ideal for use in godowns meant for long term storage of 
grains, whenever infested stocks a
rrive in godowns and during post 
fumigation periods to trap the resistant 
strains and left over insects to prevent 
build up of the pest populations. In go
downs of frequent transactions the trap 
can be used for monitoring. 
Efficiency 
 It has been found that two traps kept at the corners of the 
warehouse (60m x 20m x 5m) can catch around 200 insects/day even from a 

godown where normal sampling did no
t show any insect presence, thus 
indicating its effectiveness as a monito
ring and mass trapping device. It has 
been recorded around 3000 
Rhyzopertha dominica 
on a single day from single 
trap kept in a paddy godown. 
Significance 
National  The Food Co-operation of India ha
s entered into MOU with TNAU for 
popularisation of this trap. Already 
25 officers of all has been trained 
on this line.  M/s. Bannari Amman sugars Limited uses the UV light trap 
technology under the consultancy project with TNAU for 

management of stored grain insects in their godowns. 
International 
  M/s. Madaus Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd Goa, 
(German Firm) has adopted the UV trap 
technology to detect/mass trap cigarette 

beetle infestation in their export produce, 

senna pods/seeds (
Casia augustifolia
).  
 M/s. Saraf Trading Corporation Pvt. Ltd., 
Cochin which exports herbal tea to Europe 
uses the UV- light trap technology for 

detection/mass trapping of 
Lasioderma 
serricorne.  In Ayurvedic and Siddha Medicine factories 
UV-light trap will be used for detection of 
insects in the plant product ingredients 

used for medicines. 
vii. TNAU Stored Grain Insect Management Kit 
 Food grains are stored for varying periods to ensure proper and 
balanced public distribution througho
ut the year.  Among the biotic and 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 abiotic factors which affect grains / seeds in storage, insect plays a major role 
in the deterioration of grains / seeds ca
using both qualitativ
e and quantitative 
losses.  Often the presence of insects in
 store houses are felt only when they 
are hovering and flying around, by which time enormous loss and population 

build up of insects might have occurred.  Hence, timely detection of the 

stored grain insects will help to prevent heavy losses. 
TNAU is one of the pioneering institutes in India in the development of detection devices 
for stored grain insects.  These devices exploit the wandering behaviour of the insects 

and help in timely detection of insects in stored produce leading to timely control.  These 

include TNAU probe trap, TNAU pit fall trap
, two in one model trap, indicator device, 
Automatic insect removal bin and UV-light trap technology.  These devices have been 

widely used in many places and have received State and National recognitions. 
 Hence, the Department of Agricult
ural Entomology, Centre for Plant 
Protection Studies, TNAU, Coimbatore has developed a ﬁKITﬂ named as 

TNAU-Stored Grain Insect Pest Management Kit
 containing prototypes 
of all the devices along with a CD-R
om about the devices and how to use 
them.  This kit will be of great use in 
popularization of the technologies across 
the country.   The kit will be an ideal ﬁh
ands - on trainingﬂ tool for Education, 
Extension centers (KVK, Plant clinic, save
 grain centers) and also for private 
ware housing.  This TNAU kit is the 
first of its kind in the world.   
Significance
  The kit has been commercially launched by TNAU through MOU with 
M/s. KSNM Marketing, Coimbatore. 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
  Good response from Agrl. Colleges, KVK's, PHT's Centers across the

Coimbatore has taken up TOT of this technology and spreading this 
technology through Income generation project. 
viii. A Device to Remove Insect Eggs from Stored Pulse Seeds 
(Patent No. 198434) 
 Pulses are more difficult to 
store than cereals as these suffer a 

great damage during storage by 

pulse beetle Callosobruchus
 sp. The 
main source of infestation by pulse 

beetle is it™s carry over damage from 

field to stores which is well known.  

The present invention is a prototype 

of a gadget which can successfully 

crush the eggs of pulse beetle, 
Callosobruchus chinensis
 and 
Callosobruchus maculates
 which 
attack stored pulses. The gadget has 

outer container and an inner perforated container with a rotating rod having 

fixed with plastic brushes on all sides. Th
e seeds with eggs are to be stored in 
the perforated container and the rod ha
s to rotated one full circumference 
clockwise and anti-clockwise for 10 mi
nutes 3 times a day (morning, noon 
and afternoon). Due to the splashing acti
on of the brush in rotating rod, the 
eggs get crushed and thus the damage is prevented. The treatment does not 

affect the germination of seeds.   
Advantages of the invention 
 The device is useful in removing the eggs without affecting the 
germination  Once the eggs are removed there will not be further build up of 
population during storage of seeds. 
 Removing the eggs laid by the beetles will have a significant impact 
in arresting the population
 builds up in storage. 
 Farmers generally fear to store pulse seeds because of the pulse 
beetle damage during storage. The device of the present invention 
Pest and Disease Management: Organic Ecosystem 
 can remove this fear from the farmers mind and thus motivate them 
ﬁto have their own seedsﬂ.  The patent has been recently commercialized.  
ix. Trap for monitoring stored product insects in warehouse

perforation in the range of 1.8 to 2 mm 
on its upper portion with a bend at 
one end which ends in a transparent co
llection unit to collect the insects 
falling down from the bend, the other end of main tube being closed.  
     
     
 Advantages of the invention  
 The device is useful in detecting stored grain insects in bag stacks of 
the food grain warehouses without any damage to sacks.   
 The device does not require any bait materials to trap insects. 
 The device is useful in studying the distribution pattern of stored 
product insects in various layers of bag stacks.  
 The device will be useful to validate
 the effect of fumigation by using 
it immediately after fumigation, in 
different layers of the fumigated 
stacks.  The device will also be useful at farm level when farmers store their 
produce in bags.

Regardless of political ideology, environmental issues are becoming paramount
in all economic systems from the very poor to the very rich. India, one of the
world’s largest agricultural economies, poses no exception. Demand for
chemical pest control and resulting negative externalities have expanded
greatly during the last four decades (Chand and Birthal 1997). Three decades
back, intensive and extensive cultivation of high yielding varieties of crops
were introduced in India to increase food grain production. The new crop
varieties and cropping sequences, especially monocropping, along with
injudicious and indiscriminate use of pesticides created many problems.
Several hitherto unimportant pest species began to cause economic losses.
Others, especially polyphagous insects, have precipitated national problems
(Srinivasa 1993). One glaring example is the old world bollworm, Helicoverpa
armigera (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera), which caused a 66 per cent reduction in the
yield of seed cotton in Andhra Pradesh State during the 1987-88 crop season.
Previously, this pest only seriously affected rabi crops such as chickpea and
was commonly known as the gram pod borer. Similar outbreaks have been reported
for other insects: Whitefly in 1984-85 and 1985-86 in South Indian states, and
tobacco caterpillar in 1977-78 and 1979-80 in the states of Tamil Nadu and
Gujarat (Arunakumara 1995) and more recently, coconut mite, Aceria guererronis
(Eriophyidae: Acarinae). The agrochemical industry in India now produces
47,020 metric tons of pesticide (Directorate of Plant Protection and
Quarantine 2002). Growth in pesticide consumption by Indian Agriculture is
shown in Figure 1. Although pesticide consumption in India is low (around 500
g per ha) compared to other countries like Japan (12 kg per ha) and Germany (3
kg per ha), problems in India resulting from unregulated use are quite
alarming.  The predominant classes of pesticides used in India (during
2000-01) were insecticides, accounting for 61 per cent of total consumption,
followed by fungicides (19 %) and herbicides (17 %) (Fig 2). In India, most
pesticide use is on cotton (45%), followed by rice (22%) (Fig. 3). ![graph

In recent years, low external inputs and traditional techniques, including
non-chemical alternatives, have been increasingly urged for India. These are
viewed as technology options that could help create sustainable systems and
decrease or avoid the needs for expensive and undesirable chemical inputs.
Alternative agriculture has argued for an economically viable production to be
viewed in the context of a healthier, environmentally friendly and sustainable
chemical agriculture and the need for investment in low external input and
non-chemical alternatives that include farmer empowerment. Numerous models
exist and have been advocated and based on their respective inputs / nutrient
management principles. They may be broadly classified into: (a) Integrated
Pest Management (IPM), (b) Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA),
and (c) Organic Agriculture. Many sustainable agriculture initiatives and
approaches based on these principles have now proved successful, with use of
pesticides varying from more to only a limited amount. Of these, IPM is the
one commonly advocated and widely adopted. ## Status of IPM in India India has
an agrarian economy, where the 1012.4 million population is dependent on
agricultural commodities from 124.07 million hectares cropped area cultivated
by 110.7 million producers (Prasad 2001). For rapid dissemination of IPM
information, IPM related activities are being implemented through 26 Central
Integrated Pest Management Centers (CIPMCs) located in 23 States and Union
Territories. Major activities under the IPM approach include undertaking
sample roving surveys for monitoring pest/disease situations on major crops,
production and release of bio-control agents and conducting Farmers’ Field
Schools (FFSs). Pest/disease situations are monitored regularly in the states
covering 644,000 hectares (ha) of the targeted area of 469,000 ha.  Pest
situation reports received from field stations and states were compiled and
comprehensive weekly and monthly reports circulated to the concerned officers
and scientists of State Departments of Agriculture/State Agricultural
Universities and ICAR Institutes to help them take appropriate remedial
measures. A total of 16,260 thousand bio-control agents have been mass
produced in the laboratories and released (up to December, 2002) against
insect pests in rice, cotton, sugarcane, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds
(against the targeted release of 11,570 thousands during the year 2002-03.
(40.54 % increase than expected)  An area of 523 thousands ha has been covered
against the targeted area of 367 thousands ha. in different states against
various insect pests through augmentation and conservation  (a 42.51 %
increase over expected) (http://agricoop.nic.in/plantprotec02.htm). During the
eight-year period from 1994-95 to 2001-02, the government of India spent
nearly Rs. 14,926 million for biocontrol of pests on different crops, covering
a land area of 4.3 million hectares.  In addition to this, Rs. 59 million was
spent for pest monitoring. The largest states of India, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka, rank highest in
accomplishing IPM.  A smaller state, Punjab has also done well in IPM (Table
1). The disparity between different components of IPM accomplishment should be
noted. ** Table 1. **Accomplishments of IPM in India (During 1994-95 to
2001-02) \--- ** Major States and All India** | ** Pest Monitoring (Million

It can be also seen that the states that are progressing with IPM, are also
ahead in using synthetic agrochemicals. Figure 4 indicates such a positive and
significant relationship between consumption of pesticides and investment in
IPM. This may indicate an increase in gross cropped area accounts for the
increased expenditure on IPM rather than the policy changes of selected
districts. Table 2 shows the major bio pesticides consumed in India - _
Bacillus thuringiensis_ (Bt) and neem-based insecticides.  India needs an
improved and newer group of bio pesticides. The exponential rate of increase
in bio pesticide consumption (together with reduced synthetic pesticide
consumption) is a positive sign that India’s agricultural community is
becoming more concerned about the negative consequences of agrochemical usage.

Quarantine, Faridabad ## Economics of IPM To date, successful IPM programs
have produced many benefits. These include (i) lower production costs (at farm
level), (ii) enormous savings for governments from reduced pesticide imports
and subsidies for pesticide use, (iii) reduced environmental pollution,
particularly improved soil and water quality, (iv) reduced farmer and consumer
risks from pesticide poisoning and related hazards, and (v) ecological
sustainability by conserving natural enemy species, biodiversity, and genetic
diversity. As mentioned earlier, the acceptability of a farming practice is
primarily determined by short-term profitability. IPM attempts to integrate
available pest control methods to achieve a farmer’s most effective,
economical, and sustainable combination for a particular local situation.
Studies have been carried out to examine the resource use pattern and
profitability of IPM vis-à-vis non-IPM farming practices. The results of a
recent study are presented in Table 3. A study of the costs and returns of IPM
and non-IPM farms in rice cultivation in the Thanjavur Delta of Tamil Nadu by
Tamizheniyan during 2001 showed that IPM farms were resource efficient and
more productive and profitable than non- IPM farms. **Table 3. **Costs and

Source: Tamizheniyan, 2001. **The total cost per acre on IPM farms was Rs.
10,452 compared to Rs. 10,032 on non IPM farms. The gross return was Rs.
16,213 compared to Rs. 14,900.  The Benefit Cost Ratio was 1.62 for IPM,
compared to 1.43 for Non-IPM farms.** Similar results were obtained in another
study conducted on the economics of the IPM approach in Basmati rice (Garg
1999). The main aim of that study was to develop an IPM system in Basmati rice
that would make farmers aware of the ill effects of indiscriminate use of
pesticides and the benefits of IPM. Yield data showed that all IPM farmers
secured higher rice yields than those using conventional chemical control
tactics. It was also evident that farmer’s practice of not applying pesticide
or very little pesticide was better than the indiscriminate use of pesticide
which might have suppressed the natural enemy population. ## Farmers’
perception about hazardous effects of Pesticides Although IPM has been
accepted in principle as the most attractive option for protection of
agricultural crops from the ravages of insect and non-insect pests,
implementation at farm level in India had been rather limited (Puri 1998).
Production uncertainty is commonly believed to be an impediment to adoption of
less pesticide-intensive methods in agriculture such as IPM (Hurd 1994). To
understand the Indian farmer’s perception about hazardous effects of
pesticides, a survey was conducted among rice farmers following IPM and non-
IPM practices in the Thanjavur delta, a major rice production belt of
peninsular India (Tamizheniyan, 2001). The results are presented in Table 4.
**Table 4: **Farmers’ perception about hazardous effects of pesticides \---
**Categories ** | ** Farmers’ Perception** | **IPM farmers** | ** Non IPM
farmers** _ Pesticides are not highly hazardous to human health_ | No effect |
1 | 3 Very little effect | 5 | 10 Little effect | 5 | 15 _ Pesticides are
hazardous to human health_ | Much effect | 13 | 6 Very much effect | 11 | 4
High effect | 5 | 2 Total | 40 | 40 Source: Tamizheniyan 2001. It can be
observed that the IPM farmers were more likely to see pesticides as causing
hazardous effects to human health than were non-IPM farmers. One- sample c2
Test was employed (Appendix I) on these data and showed this observation to be
statistically significant at a 5 per cent level of significance. This
difference in attitude towards negative externality created by pesticide use
might be acting as an impediment towards adoption of pesticide saving farming
practices like IPM. ## Conclusion The increasing cost of plant protection and
accelerating  pest incidents make agriculture a risky and less profitable
enterprise. At the same time the toxic materials generated from chemical
farming pollute the environment and harm consumers’ and farmers’ health. A
more environmentally friendly and economical alternative for India would be
adoption of Integrated Pest Management. Additionally, from the viewpoint of
sustainability, attaining growth while maintaining the natural capital intact,
IPM is superior compared to conventional farming (Chopra 1993). It should,
therefore be appreciated and encouraged to a greater extent both by
governments and NGOs'. ## References * Arunakumara, V.K. 1995. _ Externalities
