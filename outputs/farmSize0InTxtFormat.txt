AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT 
EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY Achievements and Challenges in Tamil Nadu Agriculture 
 (i) Agriculture in Tamil Nadu has enjoyed thre
e decades of growth based largely on 
rapid technological change. Food security has also increased due
 to rapid increases in food grain 
output, sales from the Public Distribution System (supplied by Food Corporation of India stocks), 
targeted feeding and employment programs, and we
ll-functioning rice markets that have enabled  
price-stabilizing inflows of rice from neighboring 
states in years of local production shortfalls. 
Partly because of agricultural growth, rural pove
rty rates declined from 38.5 percent to 24.3 
percent between 1993/94 and 1999/2000 (Deaton a
nd Drèze estimates). The state™s agriculture 
has a strong base for continued growth in term
s of a strong agricultural research system, an 
extensive road network, and a relatively well-educated rural labor force.  
(ii) While agricultural sector growth rates in Tamil Nadu were among the highest in 
India during the 1980s and early 1990s, decelerati
on in growth since the mid-1990s is of 
increasing concern to policymakers
. During the 1980s agricultural GSDP grew at 3.4 percent, 
exceeding the all-India agricultural growth of 2.9 
percent. Adequate rainfall contributed to even 
higher growth in the early 1990s: between 1989/90 
and 1994/95 agriculture grew by 7.2 percent 
in Tamil Nadu, compared with 3.1 percent in 
all of India. But between 1994/95 and 1999/2000 
agriculture in Tamil Nadu suffered from severe cons
ecutive droughts and grew only 1.3 percent a 
year, compared with 2.9 percent for all of India. 
As a result, the state™s agricultural growth rate 
during the 1990s was only 2.9 percent a year, compared with 3.2 percent for all of India.  
(iii) Faster growth in agriculture is central to rural development and poverty reduction 
in Tamil Nadu. Although agriculture accounts for only 15.7 percent of total GSDP, farm income 
accounts for about half of household income for 35 million people (56 percent of the state™s 
population) who live in rural areas. Much of this 
rural population is poor, with estimates ranging 
from 7.4 million people (20.6 percent of the rural 
population) to 11.4 million (31.8 percent of the 
rural population). For the poorest rural quintile 
(approximately 1.5 million households, or 7.5 
million people), more than three-quarters of income
 is derived from agriculture, with agricultural 
wage labor alone accounting for half of household income. Given the importance of agriculture in 
the incomes of the poor in Tamil Nadu, growth in
 labor-intensive agriculture could further reduce 
rural poverty through higher yields to small produ
cers, higher real wages to agricultural laborers, 
and increased income and employment opportunities with forward and backward links to the rural 

nonfarm sector.    
(iv) Traditional sources of growth in agricultu
re face major constraints such as growing 
water scarcity, increasing land degradation, dec
lining farm sizes, and rising costs of labor
. Tamil Nadu is one of the driest states in India, 
averaging only 925 millimeters of rainfall a year. 
The state™s dry season lasts five months (January through May) even in good years, and severe 
droughts occur in 3 of 10 years, severely lim
iting cultivation of crops between June and 
September. Per capita availability of water res
ources in Tamil Nadu is only 900 cubic meters a 
year, compared with 2,200 cubic meters for a
ll of India. Irrigation through a combination of 
canals, wells, and tanks
1 increases the reliability and availab
ility of water for farming and is 
                                                     
 1 A tank is a small-scale surface water reservoir constr
ucted on a gentle slope, designed so that water flows 
out of the tank through the force of gravity.  
 vessential for cultivating crops in much of the state.
 But the seasonality and scarcity of supply limit 
cultivation to only one crop per plot for most of the state.
2 The agricultural sector faces increasing 
competition for water from industry and domestic 
users and intensifying interstate competition 
for surface water resources. In many parts of the 
state, the rate of extraction of groundwater has 
exceeded recharge rates, contributing to falling 
water tables. Water quality is also a growing 
concern. Effluents discharged from industries and 
heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers have had 
a major impact on surface water quality, soils, and groundwater.   
(v) Agricultural land resources have also come
 under increasing pressure because of 
rapid population growth and urbanization
. Between 1971/72 and 1997/98 the available 
cultivable land per rural resident declined fro
m 0.22 hectares per capita to 0.15 hectares per 
capita. The growing pressures on land, skewed 
pricing policies, and rural poverty have all 
contributed to land and soil degradation. As a r
esult, poor soil fertility, salinity, water logging, 
overgrazing, and deforestation are growing pr
oblems and pose serious constraints to the 
performance of the agricultural sector
 in some parts of the state. (vi) Seasonal labor shortages and rising real agricultural wages during the past two 
decades, in part caused by rapid rural-urban migration, have contributed to higher incomes 
for agricultural laborers, but make future agric
ultural growth more difficult by reducing 
the competitiveness of Tamil Nadu™s agriculture vis-à-vis other agricultural producers
. Higher labor costs, due in part to rapid growth in demand for nonagricultural labor, have 
increased the cost of cultivation, especially fo
r labor-intensive crops. In 1999Œ2000 rural wages 
for male agricultural labor in the kharif season in
 Tamil Nadu averaged Rs.62.2 a day, compared 
with only Rs.45.3 a day in Andhra Pradesh and 
Rs.42.8 in Karnataka. These higher labor costs 
encourage mechanized land preparation and harves
ting, but small farm sizes constrain the rate of 
mechanization. 
(vii) Given the constraints, diversification 
into higher value, less water-intensive 
products, such as fruits, vegetables, spices, a
nd livestock products, may be one of the most 
promising sources of agricultural growth
. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions are well 
suited for diversified agricultu
re. Rapidly increasing incomes a
nd changing patterns of food 
demand also provide strong impetus for diversifi
cation. Increased agricultural diversification and private investments in processing for many of
 the higher value agricultural commodities are 
likely to generate new rural nonfarm employment
 opportunities and contribute to higher rural 
incomes.  (viii) Against this background this study assess
es agricultural policies in Tamil Nadu and 
the implications of these policies for future 
agricultural growth, food security, and rural 
poverty reduction, and recommends reform options
. This report focuses on selected critical 
issues rather than a comprehensive review of the 
agricultural sector in the 
state. It analyzes the 
structure of the agricultural economy, water ma
nagement, agricultural subsidies, agricultural 
marketing and regulations, and implications of 
policy reforms for food security and consumption 
of the poor.  

The Structure of Agriculture in Tamil Nadu 
(ix) Rice dominates both food consumption and agricultural production
, accounting for about a third of total gross cropped area and near
ly 60 percent of irrigated area in Tamil Nadu 
(over 90 percent of paddy is irrigated). Pul
ses (18 percent of total cropped area), millet (11 
percent), and groundnuts (10 percent) require less water than rice or sugar cane, and millet and 
pulses are grown almost exclusively on nonirrigated 
land. About 5 percent of total cropped area is 
                                                     
 2 In 1998/99 average cropping intensity was only 1.20 in Tamil Nadu, compared with 1.34 for all of India. 
 videvoted to sugar cane, all of it irrigated (acc
ounting for almost 10 percent of irrigated land). 
Cotton occupies about 3 percent of cropped area, and 
about a third of the cotton crop is irrigated.  
(x) The livestock and fisheries subsectors are also important in Tamil Nadu
. The state 
ranks second among Indian states in egg 
production and ninth in milk production.
3 In 2001/02 
Tamil Nadu accounted for approximately 6 percen
t of national milk production and 11.9 percent 
of egg production. The state is also relatively 
well endowed with fisheries, accounting for 13.2 
percent of total marine fish production and 4 percen
t of in-land fish production in India. In all, 
crop agriculture, livestock, and animal husbandry acc
ount for 92.2 percent of total value added in 
agriculture and allied activities, with fishing 
accounting for 4.5 percent and forestry for 3.3 percent. (xi) The average size of individually held farms is
 only 0.91 hectares, with over half the 
farms smaller than 0.5 hectares
. Nearly three-quarters of farms are smaller than 1 hectare, 
accounting for only 30.2 percent total cultivable land.
 In comparison, the average farm size in 
India is 1.41 hectares, with 62 percent 
of farmers holding less than 1 hectare. 
 
Water for Agriculture 
 (xii) Agriculture is the single largest consumer of
 water in the state, using 75 percent of 
the state™s water
. Despite limited water resources, Tamil Nadu has a high percentage of net sown 
area that is irrigated (54 percent). In 1999/2000 
the state had a net irrigated area of 3 million hectares. Today the state relies equally on surface 
and groundwater sources for irrigation, though 
its reliance on groundwater has been steadily in
creasing. Approximately 30 percent of the net 
irrigated area is watered by canals and 21 percent 
by tanks, while 49 percent is fed by wells. The 
remaining area is irrigated by other sources such as streams and springs. Rainfed agriculture, 
employing approximately 25 percent of farmers, accounts for 46 percent of the net sown area of 

5.5 million hectares. 
Institutional Issues 

(xiii) Institutional weaknesses have undermined 
proper management and development of 
water resources in the state
. As is common in many Indian states, inadequate priority to and 
funding for operations and maintenance led to ra
pid deterioration of surface irrigation. There was 
also minimal involvement of farmers in the opera
tions and maintenance of irrigation systems. But 
recent efforts have been made to address many
 of the issues plaguing the water sector.  
(xiv) The Government of Tamil Nadu is now undertaking 
comprehensive water planning on 
a river basin basis
 and has decentralized water resource management along river basins. In 1995 
the Public Works Department was divided into the 
Water Resources Organization
 (WRO) and 
the Buildings Organization. The WRO is to be fo
rmalized in 2004 as a separate agency with a 
specialized cadre of staff, with
 Chief Engineers reorganized around river basins. The Palar Basin 
Development and Management Board and th
e Thambaraparani Basin Development and 
Management Board were established in January 
of 2000. Preparation of macro-level basin 
development plans and formulation of deci
sion support systems for development and 
management of the water resources of the state have been under way since 1997. The state has 
drafted a Water Policy
, initiated steps for irrigation mana
gement transfer, and passed a 
Groundwater Regulation and Management Act, one of the first states in India to do so. The 
State Legislative Assembly passed the 
Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation 
                                                     
 3 Ranks are computed based on average production in Indian states between 1999 and 2001. 
 viiSystems Bill
 in May 2000. Substantial progress has been
 made in the environmental aspects of 
water resources development. 
(xv) Tamil Nadu has implemented a number of
 centrally sponsored and donor funded 
watershed development schemes to improve the 
production potential of rainfed agriculture
. The government recently launched the Comprehens
ive Wasteland Programme, which will cover 2 
million hectares through a watershe
d development project. Waters
hed projects in India have 
enjoyed relatively little success in curbing land degr
adation, improving the pr
oductivity of rainfed 
agriculture, and reducing rural poverty, and remain
 to be carefully evaluated in Tamil Nadu. 
 Economic Incentives for Water Use: Taxes and Implicit Subsidies  (xvi) Under the current system of economic incentive
s (prices, subsidies, taxes) the cost of 
water for farmers and other water users does 
not reflect the scarcity value (opportunity 
cost) of water. Throughout India, farmers using surface 
water for irrigation from canals or tanks 
are implicitly subsidized because water char
ges fall short of opera
tions and maintenance 
expenditures. Between 1990 and 2002 farmers usin
g groundwater for irrigation in Tamil Nadu 
also benefited from free agricultural power supply.
 Subsidizing irrigation water means that the 
environmental costs of water use are not bein
g internalized, reducing incentives for water 
conservation, encouraging the cultivation of 
water-intensive crops, and contributing to 
environmental degradation. The irrigation and ag
ricultural power subsidies have contributed to 
the state™s large fiscal deficit. These subsidies also 
have a high opportunity cost in terms of other 
social and economic expenditures foregone, 
and few poor directly benefit from them.  
(xvii) In 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu 
announced increases in irrigation water charges and reintroduced a tariff for agricultural power consumers
. These reformsŠ
charging for water on a per area basis (as is the case for surface irrigation) or on a flat rate basis 
(for agricultural power consumers)Šwere a step in 
the right direction. But even these reforms did 
not result in economically efficient pricing, becau
se the marginal cost for water was almost zero 
and thus demand for irrigation water was not affected. 
(xviii) Prior to 2003, water charges were levied 
by the Government of Tamil Nadu at a 
base rate (which varied according to crop, season, and soil quality) plus an additional 
charge equivalent to six times the base rate
. This additional charge was transferred to the local 
panchayats. Beginning in July 2003, an additi
onal water charge of Rs.150 per hectare was 
imposed, de-linked from any additional cess. Thus, farmers were to pay the original charge plus 
the Rs.150 per hectare. In addition, the FMIS Ac
t empowered water user associations to charge 
users between Rs.250 and Rs.500 per hectare. This fee could be retained by the associations for 
operation and maintenance of the systems turned over to them. 
(xix) The agricultural power tariff introduced in 2003 included a flat rate for unmetered 
connections of Rs.250 per horsepower a year
 and Rs.0.20 per kilowatt-hour for metered 
connections. Along with the reintroduction of the agricultural power tariff, the government 
announced an income support scheme for smallholde
rs and marginal farmers. Under the income 
support scheme, the Government of Tamil Nadu 
was to provide smallholders and marginal 
farmers a transfer of up to Rs.1,250 a year. This
 was a significant step toward creating a more 
direct and transparent system of subsidies to 
farmers and other target groups and ensuring the 
separation of commercial operation of the power u
tility from the need for subsidy. However, the 
reintroduction of agriculture power tariff became
 a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu during 
the recent national election, forcing the governme
nt which suffered severe electoral loss for the 
national parliament seats to reverse the policy. 
 viii (xx) Nonetheless, the analysis in this report su
ggests that introduction of a flat rate 
charge of Rs.250 a year for a five horsepower pu
mpset would have only a small effect on net 
returns to land and management, reducin
g them by only 4.9 to 6.5 percent
. Costs of crop cultivation using well irrigation would rise by only
 Rs.625 per hectare (annual charge pro-rated 
for one season) to Rs.1,250 per hectare (for sugar cane grown over eleven months). 
(xxi) Raising electricity charges to the estimated 
marginal economic price of electricity to 
agriculture of Rs.3.1 per kilowatt-hour, thou
gh, would increase irrigation costs to about 
Rs.4,600 per hectare for paddy and sugar cane
, reducing returns to land and management 
by 35.9 percent for paddy  and by 23.8 percent for sugar cane
. Likewise, total returns to land, 
labor, and capital (value added) would fall sharply 
for paddy and sugar cane irrigated by wells if 
farmers bore the cost of electricity for pumping, strengthening the case for a compensating 
income support scheme in this scenario.   
Other Public Expenditures on Agriculture and Food 
 (xxii) Although public expenditures on agriculture in Tamil Nadu are high, the quality of 
expenditures is a cause for concern
. Expenditures on agriculture, 
allied activities, and irrigation as a share of agricultural GSDP are higher in Tami
l Nadu than in most major agricultural states in 
India (World Bank 2003). Between 1998 and 2000 pub
lic expenditures on agriculture equaled 11 
percent of total agricultural GSDP in Tamil Nadu,
 compared with 7.8 percent in all of India.
4 Public agricultural capital expenditures in the state are relatively low compared with the all-India 
average, while the opposite is true of revenue (i.e. 
current) expenditures  as a share of agricultural 
GSDP. This is a situation for concern since capita
l investments are important for future growth. 
Furthermore, a large share of revenue expenditu
res are incurred on staff salaries, and  food and 
irrigation subsidies, leaving operating expenses under funded. Gross fixed capital formation in 
agriculture increased by 15 percent during the 1
990s, due primarily to private capital formation, 
which accounted for 88 percent of gross fixed capital formation in agriculture.  
(xxiii) The agricultural extension system in Tamil Nadu is still organized around a 
modified Training and Visit approach and 
continues to focus on major food-grains. There is little coordination among line departments (agricultu
ral, animal husbandry, fisheries) in their 
extension approach. The extension system is sl
owly changing, however, and the promotion of 
public-private partnerships in extension is en
couraging. The Government of Tamil Nadu also 
plans to link agricultural, horticultural, and agri
cultural engineering extension systems and units 
to improve the extension capacity fo
r horticultural development.   
(xxiv) Reforms of the public procurement system and improvements in targeting are 
reducing state expenditures on food subsidies
. The Government of Tamil Nadu estimates that 
the food subsidy will fall from Rs
.15 billion in 2001/02 to Rs.7 
billion in 2003/04. Cessation of 
local procurement (except on behalf of the 
Food Corporation of India) reduced government 
expenditures on procurement by an estimated Rs.6
.8 billion by eliminating the costs of paying 
extra procurement incentives and of milling the pa
ddy into rice. Additional savings came from 
reducing the subsidy per kilogram of rice sold 
and the number of cards (and ultimately the sales 
of rice). The total estimated reduction in subsidy (from both reforms on procurement and

 ixdistribution) was about Rs.9.92 billion, with about
 two-thirds due to the cessation of Government 
of Tamil Nadu procurement on its own behalf. 
Development of Agricultural Markets 
 (xxv) In the past decade Tamil Nadu has in
creased private sector participation in 
marketing and eliminated government restrictions
. Unlike most Indian states, where 
wholesale marketing is restricted to regulated markets, Tamil Nadu permits traders to transact 
sales outside of regulated markets. Private market
s account for about 90 percent of the statewide 
trade in major crops. Regulated markets, in whic
h licensed traders bid for farmer produce through 
a tender system, account for only 10 percent.  
(xxvi) In May 2003, following the February 
2002 central Government order removing 
licensing restrictions on rice and 13 other crops, the state Government withdrew its 
licensing system for these crops
. Restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking, and sales of 
these commodities have been removed, though
 some provision remains for Government intervention in the case of high market prices for 
goods distributed through the public distribution 
system.  
(xxvii) Greater private sector participation in mark
ets has enhanced food security in Tamil 
Nadu. Increases in state production of major stap
les (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice 
through the public distribution system, school feeding programs, and targeted relief 
programs have increased access to food
. During the drought of 2002/03 the wholesale prices of 
rice only rose 2.8 percent in real terms above th
e previous year™s prices despite a 34 percent fall 
in paddy production in the state. This was 
because private sector inflows from neighboring 
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and the availability 
of rice through the public distribution system 
helped to maintain access to food for poor consumers. 
(xxviii) Private investments in processing and marketing horticultural and export crops have 
enjoyed some success (for example, tumeric exports from Erode). Contract farming involving 
business agreements for the purchase of outputs and 
often the provision of inputs and extension advice is increasing, particularly for sugarcane, cotton, and horticultural crops.   Policy Reform Options in Tamil Nadu™s Agriculture 
 (xxix) Reducing rural poverty, accelerating growth in agricultural production, and 
overcoming the constraints faced by the agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu require 
appropriate policies and investments in four priority areas
: improving the efficiency of water 
use, increasing the effectiveness of public expend
itures and agricultural extension, spurring the 
development of agricultural markets, and maximizi
ng the real income growth of the rural poor.  
 Improving the Efficiency of Water Use 
 (xxx) Long-term growth in agriculture and rural 
incomes depends in large part on using 
water efficiently
. Water management options include scaling up the pilot river basin framework 
for managing water resources holistically, allowi
ng interagency coordina
tion and public-private 
partnerships; introducing specific, legally enfor
ceable water entitlements to various users in a 
river basin and or aquifer framework; adjusting el
ectricity, water, and crop prices to change the 
 xfinancial incentives for irrigation and crop choice; and improving management practices and 
irrigation technologies (such as drip and sprinkler
 irrigation) and investing in canals and water 
storage (coupled with improved operation and maintenance). 
 (xxxi) Public administration in the water sect
or could be improved by separating 
responsibilities for water resource man
agement and irrigation service delivery
. Tamil Nadu 
is the only state in India without a separate departme
nt of irrigation, now a 
part of the Department of Public Works. Two new agencies are needed: a 
regulatory agency to allocate the share of water 
resources to agriculture, industry, and other uses,
 and an irrigation department focusing on irrigation delivery systems. A separate irrigati
on department would allow for the creation of a 
specialized cadre of irrigation specialists, instead
 of the current setup that relies on staff from the 
Department of Public Works (which also includes administration of public buildings).  

(xxxii) Irrigation management transfer is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and water user 
associations are not yet fully functional
. The transfer of irrigation management to farmers in 
line with the FMIS Act should be expedited to
 make water distribution more efficient and equitable.  
(xxxiii) Providing the right economic incentives (pric
es, subsidies, taxes) that recognize the 
opportunity cost of water is essential
 for improving water use efficiency. Raising electricity 
charges to the estimated marginal economic price 
of electricity to agriculture of Rs.3.1 per 
kilowatt-hour may not be politically feasible, but moving gradually toward marginal cost pricing 
(perhaps combined with compensation to farmers 
in the form of income transfers or a more 
reliable electricity supply) would help rationa
lize water use in Tamil Nadu. Paying greater 
attention to market infrastructure, strengthening
 research and extension to meet the needs of 
diversified agriculture, developing tools for fa
rmers to better manage 
risks, and improving 
irrigation pumpset efficiency are likely to make hi
gher power charges more palatable to farmers.  
If farmers™ costs and incomes varied according to 
the amount of electricity (and water) used with 
well irrigation, they would have an incentive to
 shift some land from water-intensive crops (rice 
and sugar cane) toward less water-intensive crops
 (including cotton, maize, and vegetables).  
(xxxiv) Increases in electricity charges would have
 little effect on overall rice production 
and market prices but a major effect on sugar cane production
. Since only about 10 percent 
of rice area cultivated is irrigated with well 
water (about 200 thousand hectares), changes in 
electricity pricing would have only marginal eff
ects on production. And since rice is also supplied 
by net public distribution (averaging 1.2 million t
ons a year from 1997/98 to 2001/02, 18 percent 
of net production) and private market trade from 
neighboring states (estimated at 1.0Œ1.3 million 
tons in the drought year 2002/03), the effect of
 lower rice production from well  irrigated areas on 
market prices of rice would likely be small.
 Impacts on sugar cane production would be much 
greater, however, as essentially all sugar cane is irrigated in part with well water.  
(xxxv) The current provisions for irrigation wat
er charges allow full cost recovery of required operations and maintenance expenditures
. The extent to which farmers are actually 
being charged the proposed water rates remains unclear.  

(xxxvi) Greater attention is also needed for 
modernizing irrigation infrastructure and 
scaling up the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies. While the use of sprinkler and 
drip technology has been promoted in the stat
e, the high capital cost of these technologies 
constrains widespread adoption by smallholde
rs and marginal farmers. More affordable 
technology or a suitable system of targeted subs
idies should be developed to increase the use of 
sprinkler and drip systems. 
 xi(xxxvii) Past experience reveals that extensive community participation with sound technical 
inputs are necessary for successful watershed programs. 
A basin perspective should be adopted 
to ensure that these initiatives do not have
 negative impacts on downstream human and 
ecological uses.   Increasing the effectiveness of public 
expenditures and agricultural extension  (xxxviii) Responding to the needs of diversified
 agriculture requires a highly effective 
research and agricultural extension system
. An assessment of the state™s comparative 
advantage in producing higher value crops for the 
domestic and export markets would also help 
in setting future research and development prioriti
es.  Re-orienting agricultural research to make 
it more farmer-responsive would likewise improve the output of a system that has enjoyed much 
success in rice technology development in the past. 
Similarly, the current extension system in the 
state remains organized around a modified Training and Visit approach and continues to be 
highly focused on major food-grains, though the pr
omotion of public-private partnerships in 
extension is a very encouraging recent  devel
opment and offers potential for both cost-savings 
and greater efficiency. Thus, it is recommende
d that the GoTN develop a new agricultural 
extension strategy to meet the changing needs 
of farmers. This could include adopting an 
integrated and decentralized extension system th
at could help build farmer organizations that 
could link with private firms to increase economic growth in rural areas.   
(xxxix) Rationalizing public expenditures and shi
fting expenditures from subsidies to 
investments in key public goods such rural 
roads, markets and agricultural research and 
extension will facilitate productivity improve
ments and diversification of agriculture to higher value products
. Tightening competition for limited fiscal resources heightens the urgency 
of appropriate public expenditure reallocati
on. Institutional reforms within government 
departments to ensure improved quality of deliver
y of rural-related public goods and services is 
also important.
 Promoting the development of well 
functioning agricultural markets  (xl) Well functioning agricultural markets are al
so important for successful agricultural 
diversification. If recent policy reforms removing restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking 
and sales of paddy and 13 other crops are consisten
tly implemented at the local level, they can be 
expected to improve marketing efficiency
, reducing the margin between producer and 
consumer/export prices. Reductions in marketing 
costs are also necessary in order for production 
increases to lead to higher agricu
ltural incomes, particularly for perishable high-value products 
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, animal products). Contr
act farming and other private sector initiatives 
should be encouraged, though the impact of
 these business arrangements on farmer incomes 
should be evaluated, as well . 
(xli) There remain, however, important roles for the public sector in promoting agro-
food system and agro-enterprise development
  In addition to policies that establish ﬁrules of 
the gameﬂ and address market failures, public i
nvestments in rural roads to strengthen rural 
connectivity can contribute to reduced costs 
of marketing.  Although Tamil Nadu has an 
extensive road network, further attention to ma
intenance and upgrading of rural roads in some 
regions may be warranted.  Given the rapidly cha
nging nature of markets in Tamil Nadu, an in-
depth study of market structure and investment needs would be useful.   
 xii(xlii) Increasing agricultural diversification will not compromise Tamil Nadu™s food 
security objectives given an effective PDS , we
ll-functioning markets and targeted nutrition 
programs
.  Greater food security has largely been 
achieved through increases in state production of major staples (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice through the PDS, school feeding 
programs, and targeted relief programs during droughts. During the recent drought of  2002/03 
the wholesale prices of rice only rose 2.8 percent (in real terms) above the previous year™s price, 

despite a 34 percent fall in paddy production in th
e state, helping to maintain access to food for 
poor consumers. This was largely due to privat
e sector inflows from neighboring states of Andhra 
Pradesh and Karnataka and the ava
ilability of rice through the PDS. 
 Maximizing Real Income Growth for the Poor 
 (xliii) Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor
.  Increased availability of water and great
er efficiency of water use in the dry 
season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops 
remains an important unresolved issue, however.  Contract farming may help overcome these 

problems, if competition between firms helps farmers 
maintain their share of the value of the final 
product sales.  The experience of Latin America 
and the Caribbean suggests that education, 
transport infrastructure, and engines of non-farm
 growth that promote female employment are 
key aspects of a success strategy to promote non-farm growth and rural poverty reduction. 
(xliv) Whether agricultural diversification reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new 
technologies and have access to markets, the 
magnitude of employment and real wage rate gains, and the size of linkage effects with 
rural non-agriculture. The implications of an agricultura
l diversification strategy involving 
higher risk crops and capital-intensive technologies (drip irrigation) must be assessed. This 
assessment should review crop and drought insu
rance instruments, and the potential for 
innovations in these instruments to enable rural fa
rmers, particularly poor farmers, to better 
manage risks.   10100200300400500600

AGRICULTURAL DEVEL0PMENT
 1. Introduction  1.1 The agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu has a 
long history of notable achievements 
and significant progress.  Construction of the Grand Anicut (dam) on the Cauvery river in the 
second century AD permitted a large expansion of
 irrigated area and rice cultivation, and a 
flourishing of the Chola kingdom.  Centuries 
later, rapid expansion of green revolution 
technology (improved seeds, increased fertilizer use,
 and irrigation) enabled the state to increase 
average rice yields by 74.4 percent between 
the trienniums ending 1972/73 and 2001/02, enabling 
production to increase by 36.2 percent in spite of 
a 21.9 percent decrease in
 area cultivated with rice.   1.2 While agricultural sector growth rates in Tamil Nadu were among the highest in 
India during the 1980s and early 1990s, decelerati
on in growth since the mid-1990s is of 
increasing concern to policymakers
. During the 1980s agricultural GSDP grew at 3.4 percent, 
exceeding the all-India agricultural growth of 2.9 
percent. Adequate rainfall contributed to even 
higher growth in the early 1990s: between 1989/90 
and 1994/95 agriculture grew by 7.2 percent 
in Tamil Nadu, compared with 3.1 percent in 
all of India. But between 1994/95 and 1999/2000 
agriculture in Tamil Nadu suffered from severe cons
ecutive droughts and grew only 1.3 percent a 
year, compared with 2.9 percent for all of India. 
As a result, the state™s agricultural growth rate 
during the 1990s was only 2.9 percent a year, compared with 3.2 percent for all of India. 

1.3 In contrast to the uneven growth in agriculture, the non-agricultural economy of 
Tamil Nadu has expanded rapidly, leading to a sh
arp decline in the share of agriculture in total output (
Figure  1.1).  The agricultural and allied services 
(livestock, forestry and fisheries) 
sector™s contribution to GSDP has declined fro
m 24.3 percent in 1980/81 to 15.7 percent in 
2001/02, one of the lowest shares in the country. By comparison, between 1980/81 and 2001/02 
the services sectors share of GSDP increased from 
40.7 percent to 51.5 percent, while the share of 
industry decreased slightly, from 35 percent to 32.8 percent.

 21.4 Despite its declining importance in th
e overall economy, however, agriculture remains a major source of employmen
t and earnings for the rural poor.  About  56 percent 
of the state™s population of 62 million (2001 Census) 
resides in rural areas and close to half (14.4 
million workers) of an estimated 29 million workers are employed in agriculture (
Table  1.1).  For 
the poorest rural quintile (approximately 1.5 milli
on households with about 7.5 million people), 
more than three-quarters of income continues to
 be derived from agriculture, with agriculture 
wage labor alone accounting for half of house
hold income. Agricultural labor accounts for 49.5 
percent of the labor force in the state, less than the all-India average of 59.2 percent.  Unlike most 
of India (with the exception of Andhra Pradesh), 
agricultural laborers outnumber cultivators by a 
1.69:1 ratio (compared with a 0.88:1 ration across 
India), further highlighting the importance of 
returns to labor for poverty reduction.

 1.5 Agricultural growth has played a major role
 in rural poverty reduction in the past 
in Tamil Nadu, and could make subs
tantial contributions in the future.  Analysis based on 
household surveys indicates that the spread of green revolution technology in the 1970s and 
1980s contributed to sizeable increases in returns to
 land, raising farmer™s incomes.  Increasing 
demand for goods and services by farm households fu
rther stimulated expansion of the rural non-
farm economy contributing to poverty reduction. 
Although rural poverty rates declined by 6.7-
14.2 percent (depending on the definition of 
the poverty line), between 1993/94 and 1999/00, 
there remain between 7 and 11 million rural poor 
in Tamil Nadu (1999/00 data), 21-32 percent of 
the rural population.  Increases in agricultural 
production, processing and trade could enable further declines in rural poverty.    
 3  Fostering Agricultural Growth in Tamil Nadu 
 1.6 Yields of major crops in Tamil Nadu are among the highest in India, but 
productivity growth has slowed in recent years
. By the late 1990s, yields of major crops grown 
in Tamil Nadu including paddy, sugar cane, cotton and groundnut were among the highest across 
major Indian states.  In 1998-99, Tamil Nadu 
had the highest rice, sugar cane and groundnut 
yields in India and cotton yields in the state were second only to Gujarat.  Increases in yields 
enabled land productivity to grow by 6.1 per
cent per year between 1987/88 and 1993/94 from Rs 
16,423/ha to Rs 23,459/ha (in constant 93/94 Rs),
 but by only 2.4 percent per year between 
1993/94 and 1999/00 (to Rs 27,099/ha in constant
 93/94 Rs).  Likewise, average labor 
productivity in agriculture increased by an aver
age of 4.6 percent per year between 1987/88 and 
1993/94 from Rs 6,881 per worker to Rs 9,024 per 
worker (in constant 93/94 Rs), but by only 2.4 
percent per year between 1993/94 and 1999/00  to 
Rs 10,434 per worker (in constant 93/94 Rs).  
1.7 Traditional sources of agricultural growth
 face major constraints including growing 
water scarcity, increasing land degradation and 
declining farm sizes, and rising costs of 
agricultural labor. Tamil Nadu is one of the driest states 
in India, with an average of only 925 
millimeters of rainfall per year. The state has a 
dry season that extends over five months of the 
year (January through May) even in good years, and severe droughts occur in three out of every 
ten years severely limiting cultivation of crops betw
een the months of June and September.  The 
per capita availability of water resources of Tam
il Nadu is only 900 cubic meters compared to an 
all-India average of 2200 cubic meters per a
nnum. Irrigation through a combination of canals, 
tanks,5 and wells, increases the reliability and availability of water for farming, and is essential 
for successful cultivation of crops in much of the 
state.  Nonetheless, seasonality of supply and 
scarcity of water limit cultivation to only 
one crop per plot for most of the state.
6  In addition to growing water scarcity, the agricultural sector
 faces increasing competition for water from 
industries and domestic users and intensifying inte
rstate competition for surface water resources. 
In many parts of the state, the rate of extr
action of groundwater has exceeded recharge rates contributing to falling water tables. Water quality issues are also of increasing concern. Effluents 
discharged from industries as well
 as heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers have had a major 
impact on surface water quality, soils and groundwater.     
1.8 Agricultural land resources have also come
 under increasing pressure because of 
rapid population growth and increasing urbanization
. The available cultivable land per rural 
resident has declined from 0.22 ha/capita to 
0.15 ha/capita between 1971/72 and 1997/98. The 
growing pressures on land coupled with skew
ed pricing policies and rural poverty have 
contributed to land and soil degradation. As a r
esult, poor soil fertility, salinity, water logging, 
over grazing, and deforestation are growing pr
oblems and pose serious constraints to the 
performance of the agricultural sector
 in some parts of the state.  1.9 Solid growth in agricultural output and employment, rapid growth in the non-
agricultural sector, and rural-urban migration have all contributed to rising real 
agricultural wages over the past two decades.  
These higher returns to labor have contributed 
                                                     
 5 A tank is a manmade small-scale surface water reserv
oir on a gentle slope, designed so that water may 
flow out of the tank through the force of gravity.  
6 Average cropping intensity in Tamil Nadu is only
 1.20, compared to 1.34 (1998-99) for all-India. 
 4to the state™s success in raising rural incomes 
and reducing rural povert
y, though unemployment 
in the dry season remains a major factor underl
ying low incomes of poor rural households.  
 1.10 However, high real agricultural wages a
nd seasonal labor shortages have also 
increased the costs of cultivation, and tended 
to reduce the competitiveness of Tamil Nadu 
agriculture vis-à-vis other states and in international markets.  
Rural daily wage rates for 
male agricultural labor in the kharif season in 
Tamil Nadu in 1999-2000 averaged 62.2 Rs/day, 
compared with only 45.3 and 42.8 Rs/day in
 Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively (
Table  1.1).  These higher labor costs have spurred m
echanization of some operations, including field 
preparation and rice harvesting, but small farm
 sizes constrain the rate of mechanization. 
 1.11 Faced with these constraints, the Governme
nt has adopted a strategy of agricultural 
diversification to accelerate agricultural growth
. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions are 
well suited to diversified agriculture. Furthermor
e, rapidly increasing incomes and changing food 
demand patterns provide strong impetus for 
diversification. The Government™s 10
th plan articulates a strategy to reinvigorate agricultura
l growth through improved productivity, higher 
cropping intensities, diversification and increasi
ng commercialization. Efficient land and water management underlie the proposed strategy for grow
th in agriculture. The Government™s recently 
announced approach to diversifying agriculture 
includes area expansion through the development 
of waste and fallow lands and crop substitution by further developing the horticultural sector. 
Emphasis is also placed on improving the productivit
y of water through the promotion of drip and 
sprinkler irrigation technology and improved irrigation practices.   
1.12 In spite of some promising recent steps, 
current price incentives do not promote 
efficient water and land resource use, and the 
research and extension system remains better 
suited for technology for traditional crops
. Existing input subsidies for power, water and 
fertilizer distort incentives for diversification and su
stainable use of natural resources. Further, the agricultural research and extension is not yet in
 a position to respond to the new demands of   
diversified agriculture. With its relatively edu
cated rural labor force and growing manufacturing 
sector, Tamil Nadu is well poised to capture the be
nefits of rural non-farm growth stimulated by 
both upstream and down stream linkages 
with diversified agriculture.   Plan of the Report 
 1.13 Against this background the objectives of
 this study are to assess agricultural 
policies in Tamil Nadu and the implications of
 these policies for future agricultural growth, 
food security and rural poverty reduction, and to recommend reform options
.  This report focuses on selected critical issues related to agricultural growth in
 Tamil Nadu, rather than a 
comprehensive review of the agricultural sector in 
the state. The analysis focuses on the structure 
of the agricultural economy, water management, 
agricultural subsidies, agricultural marketing 
and regulations, and implications
 of policy reforms for food security and consumption of the 
poor.   1.14 Chapter 2 provides an overview of the structure of the agriculture sector and the rural 
economy, focusing on the major crops and cropping 
patterns, livestock and fisheries. Chapter 3 
examines the importance of water for agricultu
re.  Chapter 4 discusses public policies and 
agricultural research and extension issues.  
Chapter 5 focuses on agricultural markets and 
marketing policies. Chapter 6 discusses issues re
lated to food security and rural poverty. The 
conclusion and policy options are presented in Chapter 7.   

1.15 This paper is based on the missions™ discussions
 with various stakeholders, including the 
Government of Tamil Nadu, farmers, agricultural laborers, private sector representatives and 
academics.  This work also draws on a backgroun
d paper, ﬁPromoting Agricultural Development 
 5in Tamil Nadu:  Perspectives, Dimensions and Potentials,ﬂ prepared by a team of researchers at 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University led by Pr
ofessor C. Ramasamy.  The study complements 
other concurrent analytic work (particular, the 
papers on  poverty and investment climate) on 
Tamil Nadu. 
 62. Overview  2.1 Tamil Nadu™s agriculture, though dominated fo
r centuries by rice cultivation in river 
basins, varies considerably across the state™
s major agro-climatic zones.  Although water 
availability limits cultivation on most land to a 
single crop, technological change in agriculture 
has enabled increased yields and production over a 
wide range of crops.  Livestock sector growth, particularly poultry and dairy products, has also accelerated in the 1990s. 
Agro-climatic Zones of Tamil Nadu 
 2.2 Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones
 based on rainfall distribution, irrigation patterns, soil types, and other ecological characteristics (
Figure  2.1, 
Table  2.1).
7  The 
Cauvery Delta which forms its own agro-ecological
 zone, enjoys relatively high rainfall relative 
to most of Tamil Nadu (1101 millimeters per yea
r), and irrigation water through canals for six to 
seven months in good rainfall years in the catchme
nt area of the Cauvery river.  The Northeast, 
which includes Chennai, includes the Palar river basin and surrounding hillsides.  Sufficient 
concentrated rainfall and slow drainage enable
 irrigation from natural and man-made tanks.  
Average annual rainfall is slightly less in the 
North zone (849 millimeters); the western zone 
which receives very little rainfall from the southwest
 monsoon is the driest region, with only 714 
millimeters of average annual rainfall.
  Total rainfall in the Southern 
zone is similar to that of the 
north zone, but there are few large river basins, 
apart from the Tambraparni which flows south in 
Tirunelveli district.  The two remaining zones receive
 more rainfall than the rest of the state.  The 
High Rainfall zone, located in the southern tip of Tamil Nadu (Kanniyakum
ari district), receives 
heavy rainfall from the southwest monsoon, (annual 
average rainfall of 1457 millimeters).  In the 
Hilly zone that includes the mountains in Wester
n Tamil Nadu, (Nilgiris district and the western edge of several other districts), numerous types of tree crops are cultivated.

 7 2.3 Rice is the major crop in the Cauvery delta zone and the Northeast zone, 
(52.4 and 42.3 percent of gross area cultivated, respectivel
y), but plays a smaller role in the farming 
systems of the drier Western and Northwestern zones
 (9.6 and 15.9 percent of gross area 
cultivated, respectively) (
Table  2.2).  In these latter areas, other cereals, (millets, sorghum and 
maize) account for 18.8 and 24.6 percent of gross 
area cultivated, respectively.  Cropping patterns 
are more diversified in the Western, South, and High Rainfall zones, where the share of crops 
other than cereals, pulses, sugar cane, cotton a
nd groundnuts, is 38.1, 27.9 and 46.2 percent, respectively.  Tree crops dominate the cropping patterns in the Hilly zone.

 2.4 Multiple cropping in Tamil Nadu is severely limited by the relatively low levels of 
rainfall, concentrated in only a few months of the year
.  Only one crop per year can be grown 
in the upland areas in most parts of the state. 
 Even in river valleys, 
water availability through 
 8surface irrigation in canals is sufficient for two cr
ops in only a few areas, and depends heavily on 
the extent and timing of the southwest monsoons. 
 Likewise, water availability through irrigation 
from tanks or wells is limited in the dry season. 
 Thus, although 55 percent of net area cultivated 
in Tamil Nadu is irrigated, the cropping intensity 
is only 1.2.  In the drier south region (zone 6), 
the cropping intensity is only 1.06 (Ramasamy et. al., 2003) . 
Major Crops  2.5 Rice dominates both agricultural production
 and food consumption, accounting for 
about one-third of total gross cropped area and 
nearly 60 percent of irrigated area in Tamil Nadu (Figure  2.2, Table  2.3). About 5 percent of total cropped area is devoted to sugar cane, all 
of it irrigated (accounting for almost 10 percent of irrigated land). Pulses (18 percent of total 
cropped area), millets (11 percent) and groundnuts 
(10 percent) require less water that rice or 
sugar cane, and, millets and pulses are grown al
most exclusively on non-irrigated land.  Cotton 
occupies only about 3 percent of cropped area; a
bout one third of the cotton crop is irrigated 
(Figure  2.3).  Water shortages, ample supplies of 
Food Corporation of India rice stocks, and 
potential for cultivation of higher value crops un
derlie the Tamil Nadu government™s policy of 
promoting crop diversification.

 9  2.6 In most of Tamil Nadu, a single rice cro
p is grown, planted some time between 
August and October in anticipation of the onset of the northeast monsoons and harvested 
four to five months later.8  In the Cauvery delta region, which accounted for 33 percent of rice 
area cultivated in 2001/02, two rice crops are grow
n on land where sufficient water is available. On about 120 thousand hectares of cultivated land, the 
kuruvai (June/July Œ October/November) 
rice crop is followed by 
thaladi (October/November Œ February/March) in the four major 
districts9.  On another 200-240 thousand hectares of land, there is generally insufficient water for 
two crops (because of drought or lack of canal water), and a single 
samba  crop (August-January) 
is grown. Total gross cultivated area of rice in 
these districts is thus 440-480 thousand hectares.
 10   2.7 Rice production increased rapidly in Tamil Nadu from the 1950s to the 1970s, as 
green revolution technology (high-yielding varieties, fertilizer, and irrigation) spread
.  Area 
planted to paddy in Tamil Nadu expanded by 
52.6 percent from 1.73 million hectares in 1950/51 
to an average of 2.64 million hectares in 1970s, in
 part due to increased well irrigation.  Yields 
also increased, from an average of 1.31 tons of 
paddy (in rice equivalent) in the 1950s to 1.94 
tons in the 1970s.  As a result, average producti
on in the 1970s was 87 percent higher than that of 
the 1950s (Rajagopalan, 2000).    
2.8 Area planted to paddy peaked in 1979/80 (2.906 million hectares), but has declined 
steadily since that time, from 2.82 million h
ectares for the triennium ending (TE)  in 
1979/80 to 2.13 million hectares fo
r the triennium ending in 2001/02 (a 24.4 percent decline 
in total).  Yield increased by 67.6 percent over the 
same period (from 2.02 to 3.39 tons/ha), more 
than outweighing the decline in area.  The most ra
pid period of yield growth occurred in the late 
1980s: from the triennium ending in 1985/86 to 1990/01, yields increased by 44.1 percent from 
2.14 to 3.08 tons/hectare.  Overall for the en
tire period (1979/80 to 2001/02), production of rice 
increased 26.7 percent, reaching a peak of 8.14 million tons in 1998/99.     
2.9 Sugar cane, with a duration of 11 months, is grown on land irrigated by canals and 
wells.11  About 10 percent of irrigated area is plante
d with sugar cane and the crop requires, on 
average 1800 millimeters of water per unit area cu
ltivated.  Given that a single crop remains in 
the field year-round, however, its 
total water use per crop per year
 is less than two crops of paddy, but still greater than any other crop.  
Over all, sugar cane, which accounted for 5.16 
percent of gross cropped area in 2000-2001 used an estimated 14.0 percent of irrigation water 
resources.  Sugar cane yields in Tamil Nadu (109 to
ns/ha) are the highest in India (all-India yield 
is 68 tonnes/ha).  Four-fifths of sugar cane is sold 
directly to sugar mills; the remainder is used to 
make jaggery (i.e. gur or unrefined sugar).  
Government support prices have maintained output 
price incentives for sugar production over time.  While
 real market prices for paddy have declined 
                                                     
 8 The timing of the cropping seasons shown here and elsewhere in this report are approximate, and vary 
somewhat across regions and according to
 the timing of the monsoon rains. 
9 Figures on crop area by season are for the four districts of the Cauvery delta as defined by the Department 
of Agriculture: Thiruchirapalli, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur,
 and Nagapattinam.  Two other districts, Karur and 
Perambular, districts are included in the Cauvery Delta 
agro-climatic zone in the tables in this report.  
10 See Hazell and Ramasamy (eds.), (1991) for a detailed description of cropping patterns in North Arcot 
(Vellore and Thiruvannamalai districts).    
11 A second 
ratoon
 crop, grown from the roots and base of the stalks from the first harvest, is cultivated on 
approximately 70-80 percent of the area planted to sugar cane.

  10by an average of 4.8 percent per year from 1990 to 
2000, real prices of sugar cane have increased 
slightly over the same period (0.5 percent per year) (

 2.10 Cotton cultivation declined during the 1990s by 2.38 percent per year due to 
increased incidence of pests and diseases, the hi
gh cost of pesticides, and unstable output 
prices.  Cotton is cultivated throughout the state except 
in the high rainfall zones, with the largest 
concentration in the drier southern zone (
Table  2.5).   Although cotton requires less water than 
rice (about 600 millimeters per season), it is a 
longer duration crop (six months) than rice 
(generally 4 months).  Thus, cotton cultivation in
 most of Tamil Nadu requires some irrigation.  
 11Nonetheless, it does not grow well in water-l
ogged soils, making cotton cultivation difficult in 
canal systems with heavy soils and lack of wate
r control.  As a result, cotton cultivation is 
concentrated in the western zone, where irrigati
on in drier months is s
upplied by well water.  
Biological control methods that include intercroppi
ng of cotton with other plants have enabled a 
reduction in pesticide use in recent years.  Co
mmercial cultivation of genetically modified Bt 
cotton commenced in Tamil Nadu during 2002. (
Text Box  2.1).  Only about 50,000 tons of the 
600,000 tons of cotton lint used annually by 
the state™s textile factories (mainly around 
Coimbatore) are produced in the state; the bulk of
 the cotton lint derives from Maharashtra, other 
Indian states, and imports.

   122.11 Production of cholam (sorghum/jowar),
 cumbu (pearl millet/bajra), and ragi 
(mundua/finger millet) increased slightly in 
the 1980s, but declined in the 1990s,
 registering overall growth rates of -2.33, -2.05 and -1.02 pe
r cent respectively over the entire period.  These 
crops (included along with maize in the broad category of ﬁmilletsﬂ in Tamil Nadu), are grown 
almost exclusively on non-irrigated land, as cumbu 
and ragi are particularly drought tolerant.  
Often planted on non-irrigated land in December/
January after the northeast monsoon has ended, 
the crop survives on residual moisture and is harv
ested in the dry season (around April).  Shifts in 
food habits due to increased income and urba
nization have reduced demand for these crops, and 
real prices of cholam declined by 1.4 percent pe
r year over the 1980s and 1990s, despite the slow 
growth in production (
Table  2.4).      
Text Box  2.1:  Bt Cotton in Tamil Nadu 
  2.12 Maize production has increased very rapidly (by 8.25 percent per year) over the last 
two decades from just 20 thousand tons in 1980-81 to 118 thousand tons in 2001-02
, due to an increase in demand from the poultry and ot
her livestock feed industries. Production is 
concentrated in western and southern zones, the 
two zones with the lowest annual rainfall.  There 
has been little change in average yields, whic
h have hovered at about 1.6 tons/hectare. 
2.13     Groundnut production increased by 5.07 percent per year in the 1980s, but 
stagnated during the 1990s (declining by 0.50 percent year), due to a decline in area 
cultivated (Table  2.7).  Slack demand for groundnuts, reflected 
in an average decline in real 
market prices of 2.6 percent year in the 
1990s, has reduced producer incentives, as well (Table 
 2.4).  Nonetheless, yields have increased by an
 average of 3.32 percent over the 1980s and 1990s.  
Groundnuts require far less water than rice and do not
 perform well in water-logged soils, so they 
Genetically modified Bt cotton has been grown commercially in Tamil Nadu since 2002 and is 
currently the only biotech crop that has been approved for commercial cultivation in the state. Bt cotton 
contains the gene for Cry1AC which provides a high degree of resistance to the bollworm, a common 
pest whose larvae feed on cotton bolls. The technology introduced into India through a collaboration 
between Monsanto and the Maharashtra Hybrid 
Seed Company (Mahyco) 
received commercial 
approval in 2002 with farmers in Tamil Nadu harvesting their first crop of Bt cotton in 
January/February, 2003.   
 According to data from Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Ltd. (MMB) 295 farmers have planted Bt 
Cotton over an area of 374 hectares in Tamil Nadu.  Of the 925 packets of seed sold during the 2002 
Kharif crop, 745 were of the MECH 162 variety, with the remaining 180 being of the MECH 184 
variety
.    Early experience from the state indi
cates that pesticide use against bollworms dropped by 65-70 percent 
on most farms and farmers realized an average yield in
crease of 30 percent  (MMB).  As a result of the 
drought in Tamil Nadu last year the pest pressure wa
s low resulting in the Bt cotton crop faring fairly 
well in the state in comparison to other southern states which grew Bt cotton. Normally farmers spray 
8-10 times for controlling bollworms in their cotton crop.  As many as 15 sprays may be needed in 
some districts of Tamil Nadu.  Farmers cultivating Bollgard in 2002-03 managed their crop with a 

maximum of 4 sprays.  In most cases farmers only used 2-3 sprays in the Bollgard Cotton crop, 
compared to 6-8 sprays used in other commercial cotton crops. 
 
As pest related damage on cotton plots in India is fairly high (averaging 50-60 percent), the yield 
effects of Bt cotton in field trials in India have b
een larger than those observed in countries such as 
China and the United States where pest pressure is lower and farmers exhibit a higher rate of pesticide 
adoption.  It is still too early to assess the real 
success of Bt cotton in Tami
l Nadu.  Increasing bollworm 
resistance to Bt resulting from 
poor farm management practices 
is growing cause for concern. 
 13are typically grown from December through April,
 after the heavy monsoon rains.  Nonetheless, 
for 35 percent of area cultivated, supplemental irrigation is used in the dry season. Groundnut 
cultivation is concentrated in the Northeast 
and North zones which account for 70 percent of 
groundnut area cultivated, (45.7 and 24.5
 percent, respectively).     
2.14 The share of gross cultivated area devot
ed to horticultural and other crops has 
increased from 15.1 percent in 1980-81 to 19.5 p
ercent in 1990-91, but has remained at only 
19.1 percent in 2001-02
.  In 2002-03 approximately 815,000 hectares (12.5 percent of total 
cropped area) was under horticultural crops. Plantation crops accounted for 29 percent of the 

horticultural crop area with fruits, vegetables and spices accounting for a further 28 percent, 22 
percent and 19 percent, respectively. The re
cently announced Comprehensive Wasteland 
Programme aims at promoting perennial horticulture crops on 2 million hectares of cultivable 
wastelands in the state. The 
state has also been promoting the cultivation of medicinal and 
aromatic plants with these crops accounting for 
approximately 5000 hectares (less than 1 percent 
of total cropped area). There is a growing interest in bio-fuel crops (Jatropha and Paradise Tree) 
although these crops are yet to be grown commercially in the state.

 Output Price Incentives: Nominal Rat
es of Protection for Major Commodities 
 2.15 For most of the last two decades, produ
cers of rice and cotton in Tamil Nadu have 
been implicitly taxed through price and trad
e policies that kept domestic prices below 
 14border prices
.12 The nominal protection coefficient (NPC) for paddy, calculated as the domestic 
price (in this case the procurement price for common variety paddy), divided by the border price,  
averaged only 0.64 in the 1990s; i.e. the procur
ement price was on average 36 percent below the 
border price (Table  2.8).  Similarly, cotton (kapas) prices  were 26 percent below border prices 
(average across India).  Sugar prices, however, 
were 21 percent higher th
an border prices in the 
1980s and only 8 percent below border prices in the 1990s.  2.16 There has been no implicit taxation of rice in Tamil Nadu through price and trade 
policies in recent years, however
.  NPC™s for paddy in 2001-02 are, in fact, slightly positive.  
Cotton (all-India average) remains taxed relativ
e to international prices, as does groundnut.
13  Prices of refined sugar are likewise near (import parity) border prices.  Thus, estimated trade 
distortions for the two most water-intensive ma
jor crops in Tamil Nadu (paddy and sugar cane) 
have declined, and were mi
nimal in 2001 and 2002.

Agricultural Inputs: Fertilizer Use and Mechanization 
 Average fertilizer consumption in Tamil Nadu has increased
 over the years with consumption 
per hectare increasing from 107.86 Kg in 1986/87 to
 121.03 Kg in 1999/00, an average annual 
growth rate of 1.90 percent per annum. Aver
age per hectare consumption was  66.7 Kg for 
Nitrogen, 28.33 Kg for Potash and 26.01 Kg 
for phosphorous. Approximately 67 percent of 
households growing crops report use of fertilizers (
Table  2.9).  The proportion of farmers 
reporting use of fertilizers is slightly lower than Punjab and AP, but higher states such as 

Maharashtra and Karnataka. 

                                                      
 12    Note that the nominal protection coefficients 
do not include any adjustment in exchange rates.  
Accounting for the overvaluation of the rupee in the 1980s and early 1990s would raise the estimated 
border price in rupee terms and lowe
r the nominal protection co
efficients in this period.  Thus, the degree 
of taxation on Tamil Nadu agriculture in the 1980s 
and early 1990s is understated in Table  2.8.   
13   The estimated 21 percent implicit taxation of groundnuts relative to world prices may reflect domestic 
constraints in processing and marketing, as well as 
differences in quality of groundnuts for alternative end 
uses (direct consumption and crus
hing for groundnut cake and oil).

 2.17 Rates of pesticide consumption appear to be declining over time
 with growing 
awareness of the deleterious health effects of expos
ure to chemicals, the use of organic pesticides 
and the adoption of pest resistant varieties of crops
.  Despite this farmers 
in Tamil Nadu appear to 
be more likely to use pesticid
es and weedicides as compared to farmers in Neighboring states 
such as AP, Karantaka and Maharashtra.  Approximately 53 percent of farmers in Tamil Nadu 
report using weedicides and about 86 percent repor
t using pesticide, insecticides, fungicides etc.  
The proportion of households reporting using pestic
ides is comparable to Punjab.  Approximately 
67 percent of farmers report using improved varieties of seeds. The proportion of farmers using 

improved varieties of seeds in Tamil Nadu is less than most southern Indian states and Punjab 

where close to 80 percent of farmers use improved seed varieties.  
2.18 The degree of mechanization in agriculture 
in Tamil Nadu is still relatively low
 although it is higher than most southern states. According to data from the 54
th round of the NSS 
(1998), only 50 percent of  agricultural households
 in the state used tractors or power tillers 
(Table  2.9).  While the degree of mechanization is re
latively low compared to Punjab where more 
than 90 percent of agricultural households reported using tractors/power tillers it is higher than most southern state including Andhra Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Karnataka. The majority of 
households  (89 percent)  using tractors or power tillers in Tamil Nadu  rented these services.  
Land  2.1 Current land distribution and use in much
 of Tamil Nadu reflect centuries old 
patterns of settlement and cultivation in the valleys and plains
.14  In pre-colonial society, 
                                                     
 14 Baker (1984) distinguishes a third major region, Kongunad, in western Tamil Nadu (approximating the 
modern districts of Coimbatore and Erode), as a mix of plains and valley geography and society.  P.93f 
 16river valley villages, where agriculture centered on 
irrigated rice, were divided into two exclusive 
groups: the land owning Brahman and Vellala (nobl
es), and the outcaste laborers (usually Pallan 
or Paraiyan) (Baker, 1984:87).  The economy of the 
drier plains with generally poor soils outside 
the valleys was based on livestock, hunting, culti
vation of millet, and non-agricultural activities.
15   2.2 The average farm size (individual holdings) 
in 1995-96 was only 0.91 hectares, with 
52.5 percent of farms less than 0.5 hectares
 (Table  2.10). 74.3 percent of farms were less than 
1.0 hectare, accounting for only 30.2 percent of the land.

Land Resource Policy and Administration   
 2.19 There is no explicit statement of State Land Use policy in Tamil Nadu; the policies 
are implicit in the legislative and administra
tive measures related to the regulation of land 
use.  The Revenue Department administrates all 
the government lands including those vested 
with the various departments of the state gove
rnment.  Following the Tamil Nadu Patta Pass 
Book Act, 1983, private owners of agricultural land 
are issued Patta pass books.  These serve as 
evidence of ownership that facilitates loans fro
m financial institutions, co-operative banks and 
commercial bank. 
2.20 Land reforms in India were designed to (1) to
 enhance the productivity of land (2) to 
ensure distributive justice (3) to create a syst
em of peasant proprietorship and (4) to transfer the incomes of the few to many so
 that the demand for consumer goods would be 
created.  By 1972, laws had been passed in all the 
States to abolish intermediaries. In Tamil 
Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Or
issa, measures in the form of an order for 
staying ejection have been adopted to give tem
porary protection to the tenants. As a result of 
these measures, 92 per cent of the holdings in Indi
a are wholly owned and self-operated.  By the 
year 1972, ceiling legislation had been passed in 
all the States. Land ceilings in Tamil Nadu (4.86 
hectares for irrigated land with two crops; 12.14
 hectares for irrigated land with one crop and 
24.28 hectares for dry land) have relatively little 
effect on land distribution, however, due to 
registration of land in the names of various family
 members, and reportedly even in the names of 
                                                     
 15 ﬁThe importance of agriculture in the valleys made
 control of land the crucial feature of social 
organiztion.  By contrast the crucial feature in the 
plains was control of men– The importance of military 
service and, to a lesser extent, the production of goods and services, laid great stress on the control of men 
and their ability to work or fight.ﬂ Baker, p. 90. 
 17workers (with their knowledge).  Nonetheless, th
e number of farms greater than 10 hectares is 
rather small (0.33 percent), accounti
ng for only 8.41 percent of area (
Table  2.10). 
Livestock  2.21 The performance of the livestock sector has been strong. 
The livestock sector 
(including animal husbandry, poultry and dairy) is
 an important contributor to Tamil Nadu™s 
agricultural growth.  This sectors is also important for rural livelihoods offering a source of 
income and employment. For many rural househ
olds livestock are the main instrument for 
savings and insurance. Livestock also provide a source of power for tilling land and organic 
fertilizer (manure). According to the last census,
 TN had about 5.3 percent of India™s livestock 
population. Thirty-eight percent of the livestock population comprises of cattle, 11 percent of 
buffaloes, 25 percent goat, 20 percent sheep a
nd 2 percent pigs  (Livestock Census, 1997).
16  TN 
ranks second among Indian states in egg producti
on and nineth in terms of milk production.
17  Approximately 6 percent of national milk prod
uction came from TN in 2001/02 and the state 
accounted for 11.9 percent of  India™s egg production. 
2.22 There is significant growth potential for the livestock and poultry sectors arising 
from growing consumer demand.
  With increasing urbanization and growing per capita 
incomes, the demand for animal products (meat, 
eggs and dairy) in Tamil Nadu have been 
increasing. Production of the main animal products
 has also been increasing to meet consumer 
demand.  Milk production in the state has increased from 3.29 million tones in 1986-87 to 4.90 
million tones in 2000-2001. Milk production increased at an average annual rate of 4 percent. Egg 

production has also increased by approximately 
4 percent per annum in the 1990s. Growth of  
meat production has been much slower averagi
ng 1 percent per annum between 1996/97-99/00. 
Cross bread cows contribute to approximately 37 per
cent of the milk produced in the state, while 
indigenous breads and  buffaloes contribute roughly 
26 percent and 37 percent, respectively. Milk 
yields (yield per animal) from crossbred cows of 
5.72 Kg/day are slightly lower than the all-India 
average of 6.36 Kg/day, but significantly lower than
 yields in Punjab (8
.7 Kg/day).  The same 
trend can be observed for yields from buffalo
es which is 3.68 Kg/day. Yield from indigenous 
cows (2.4 Kg/day) are comp
aratively high compared to most India states.   
2.23 Most of the poultry production in the state derives from large commercial units
. 70 percent of  poultry products are produced by 
commercial farmers with 
the remaining 30 percent 
being produced by small holders (personal comm
unication with Secretary, Animal Husbandry). 
While this increases efficiency 
in production, food safety concerns and concerns for animal 
welfare will increase. Environmental effects, pa
rticularly eutrophication from high levels of 
phosphorous and nitrogen runoffs, could become pr
oblematic without proper regulation. Small-
holders may be crowded out of the sector since by its structure the industry lends itself to 
economies of scale. The growth in the poultry i
ndustry has contributed to rapidly increasing 
demand for maize as poultry feed. 
2.24 Unlike poultry production, the dairy industry is still dominated by small-holders.
 Much of the milk produced in the state is ma
rketed through milk producers cooperatives. In 2001-
2002 the state had 8,238 Dairy Cooperative Societies with a membership of approximately 2.04 
million members. The number of dairy coopera
tives and farmer members in Tamil Nadu has 
almost quadrupled since the early 1980s (NDDB, Annual Report, 2000/01). The commercial 

sector produces 30 percent of milk, with small 
holders (who have an average of 1-3 cows)

ersonal communication with Secretary, Animal 
Husbandry).  Recent drought in the state has re
duced fodder production which has implications 
for the quality of milk yields from cows and 
buffaloes. Adequate cold storage and further 
improvements in veterinary services are needed 
for this sector to realize its full potential. 
Fisheries 
 2.25 Tamil Nadu™s fisheries sector has significan
t potential, but its performance has been 
mixed.  
The state has a coastal length of 1,076 km, equi
valent to 15% of India™s coast line and is 
also well-endowed in terms of in-land fisheries.  The inland fisheries sector has about 370,000 ha 
of water spread area, comprising of 52,000 ha of reservoirs, 97,700 ha of major irrigation and 
long seasonal tanks, 158,100 ha of
 short seasonal tanks and ponds 
and 63,000 ha under estuaries, backwaters and swamps.

 2.26 The contribution of the fisheries sector to
 total agricultural and allied sector GDP 
has decreased over the past two decades from 
roughly 7% in the early 1980s to 4.5% in 
2001/02 
(Figure  2.4:). Growth in the fisheries sub sector 
has fluctuated and growth rates 
consistently fall below all-India averages.  Pr
oduction is around 0.5 million tones with four-fifths 
of fish production from wild fisheries (marine fi
sheries). The state™s fish
 production accounts for 13.2 percent of total marine fish production and 4 
percent of total in-land fish production in India 
(GoTN, 2001c).  
2.27 Marine fisheries are an important export
 earner for the state and accounted for 
5.5% of total export earnings in 2001
. The coast of Tamil Nadu has also become attractive for 
investment in shrimp culture. However growth 
in shrimp production has slowed down since a ban 
was imposed on shrimp culture in the Coastal Regul
ation Zone (area within 50 metres of the coast 
line) due to growing problems with salinity  (GoTN, 2001c).   
 The Rural Non-farm Sector 
 2.28 The non-farm sector is an important so
urce of income and employment for rural 
households in Tamil Nadu
.  Data from 1993/94 indicate that on average income from non-farm 
sources accounted for 46.4 percent of rural house
holds incomes. The average real per capita 
 190102030405060Income Quintiles

Other sources
income in 1993/94 was Rs 4,867. In Tamil 
Nadu the share of non-farm income increases 
monotonically with households wealth. For the 
lowest expenditure quintile, non-farm incomes accounted for 19.8 percent of household incomes, on 
average.  In contrast, income from non-farm 
sources contributed slightly more than half of household income for 
the  wealthiest quintile.                       
  2.29 The Government of Tamil Nadu has enco
uraged development of the non-farm sector through the Tamil Nadu Khadi and V
illage Industries Board established in 1960.  The Board promotes Khadi and Village Industries 
in order to create employment opportunities for 
rural artisans. Khadi industries are involved in the  production of cotton, wool, silk and muslin 
while village industries engage in production ac
tivities that are mineral-, forest-, polymer and 
chemical-, agro-, engineering-, textile-, and service-based. 
The Board provides financial assistance 
to artisans to start their own industries.
 In 2000-01 Khadi and Village Industries provided employment for approximately 1 million worker
s. Among the various industries, almost 71 
percent of employment was in agro-based indus
tries with Palm Gur production alone accounting 
for 60 percent of employment in Khadi and Village industries  (
Figure  2.6:).  Total earnings of 
the Khadi and Village based industries in 2000/01 amounted to approximately Rs 2.7 billion.  
Other important industries in term
s of employment creation were 
pottery, bee-keeping and village 
leather production.

 2.30 Continued growth of the agro-processing sector is likely
. Value added in the agro-
processing sector in Tamil Nadu grew by 
3.4 percent between 1989/90 and 1997/98, the 
latest year for which data is available
  (Table  2.12).
 Population growth, rising incomes, and 
increased urbanization will foster an increasing 
shift in demand from raw, unprocessed products 
to high value processed foods. Food products and 
cotton textiles accounted for 10 percent  and 28 
percent of net value added by the industrial sector
 in the late 1990s (1997/87). By 1997/98 four 
agro-processing industries, cotton spinning, w
eaving and processing, processing, manufacture 
and refining of sugar, processing 
and blending of tea and grain milling accounted for 87 percent 
of value added in the agro-processing sector and clos
e to 80 percent of employment in the sector 
(Figure  2.7:). 
2.31  In order to encourage growth of the agro-processing sector Tamil Nadu has 
recently launched the New Anna Marumalarchi Thittam
. The 2002-03 Budget speech 
announced the restructuring of the existing A
nna Marumalarchi Thittam scheme into the New 
Source:   Lanjouw, Jayaraman and Kijima, 2003
 20Anna Marumalarchi Thittam which will place 
special emphasis on the agro-processing sector. 
The new scheme in effect since June 2002 encour
ages the development of 
small scale agro-based 
industries such as processing of horticultural prod
ucts, flower based extracts, coir and food 
processing. Under the scheme, investment in agro-based industries w
ill be encouraged in each of 
the 385 Blocks of Tamil Nadu through a packages of subsidies and incentives.

 223. Water for Agriculture 
 3.1 Tamil Nadu is a water scarce state. The annual 
per capita availability of water resources 
of Tamil Nadu is only 900 cubic meters compared 
to an all-India average of 2200 cubic meters. 
The rainfall received by the state is highly variable
 and drought conditions prevail in three out of 
every 10 years.  Water is an essential factor 
of production for agriculture, which consumes 75% 
of the state™s water resources.  Faced with growing scarcity, increasing demand for water from 

industries and commercial uses, and intensifying  
interstate competition for water, improving the 
productivity of water (ﬁgetting more crop from every 
dropﬂ) in irrigated and rainfed agriculture is 
of great urgency in Tamil Nadu.  
3.2 Improving the productivity of water in agriculture needs commitments to policy, 
institutional and management reforms as well as investments in crop research, technology and 
infrastructure. Tamil Nadu has already embarked 
on a process of reform including decentralizing 
water resources management along river basins, fo
rmalizing irrigation management transfer to 
users, revising water tariffs, and promoting wa
ter saving technologies.  Commencing with a brief 
introduction to water resources in the state, th
e following chapter elaborates on recent reforms 
and the challenges that lie ahead for the state to
 increase agricultural growth while meeting the 
needs of other uses.  
Water Resources  
 3.3 Geographically, most of Tamil Nadu is a dr
y plain, with river valleys surrounded by 
low hills.  The normal rainfall in the plains in the state is 925 millimeters per year, concentrated 
during two monsoon seasons-the southwest a
nd the northeast monsoon (Agrostat, 2001).
18 Most 
of the rains from the southwest monsoon extending
 from June through September are blocked by 
mountains (the Western Ghats), on Tamil Nadu™s 
western border with Kerala and Karnataka.  
Except in the southern tip of Tamil Nadu (especi
ally Kanniyakumari district), the southwestern 
monsoons are highly variable. The northeast mons
oon rains, from October through December are 
more reliable and on average account for 47 percent of
 annual rainfall in the state. Little rain falls during the winter (January-Februar
y) or summer (March-May).   
                                                                                 Figure 
 3.1:  Rainfall and Agricultural & Allied GSDP 
 3.4 Rainfall in the state is highly variable and 
has a pronounced effect on the performance of 
the agricultural sector
 (Figure  3.1, Table  3.1). In 
six years between 1980 and 2001 total rainfall was 
less than 90 percent of the average for the two 

decades.  For these years, 
 real agricultural GDP was on average 8.1 percent below trend GDP. A 
regression analysis shows that a one percent 
increase in rainfall relative to the mean is 

associated with a 0.3 percent increase in real 

agricultural GDP relative to the trend agricultural 
GDP. 19   
                                                      
 18 India™s average annual rainfall is 1,100 mm per year. 
19 The regression equation is y=0.001+ 0.298x where y is the percent deviation in agricultural GDP from 
its logarithmic trend value, and x is the percent devi
ation in total rainfall from its mean value over the 
period.  The standard deviation of the estimated coefficient on x is 0.100, t-statistic is 2.97 and the R
2=0.31.

3.5 Tamil Nadu has 17 river basins
 (including groups of minor basins), all flowing eastwards 
from the Western Ghats and Deccan plateau.
20  The major rivers in the state are the Cauvery, 
Palar, Vellar, Vaigai and Tambaraparani. The Cauv
ery delta, the largest river basin in the state, 
has been the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu for over 1500 years since the construction of the Grand 
Anicut (dam), which diverted water from the Ca
uvery to a system of irrigation canals. Water 
from the Cauvery is used to irrigate approxima
tely 20 million hectares of land in Tamil Nadu. 
Cauvery water is shared with Ka
rnataka (located upstream) and is the subject of ongoing disputes 
between the two states.   3.6 The state™s water resources are divided near
ly evenly between surface water (23.6 
billion cubic meters) and groundwater (22.3 billion cubic meters)
.  Utilization rates are 
estimated to be 93% for surface water and 60% for groundwater. In many parts of the state, the 
rate of extraction of groundwater has exceeded recharge rates contributing to falling water tables.  
Out of 385 blocks in the state 23 percent are 
dark (extraction exceeding 100 percent of the recharge), another 23 percent of blocks are grey (extraction exceeding 65 percent of the 
recharge). The dark and grey blocks are particularly concentrated in the Western and North-
Western Zones.  3.7 Water quality issues are of increasing importance
. Effluents discharged from industries 
involved in dying and bleaching, as well as increasi
ng use of fertilizers and pesticides, have had a 
major impact on surface water quality, soils and grou
ndwater.  For example, in the Noyyal river, 
a tributary of the Cauvery river, uncontrolled disch
arge of total dissolved solids have adversely affected agriculture as pollutants have contaminated water sources and soils.   
Overview of  Water Use in Agriculture 
 3.8 Most farmers own only irrigated land or
 non-irrigated land; few farmers own 
significant amounts of both irrigated and non-irrigated land
.  According to data from the 55
th round of the Indian National Sample Survey (N
SS), in 1999/00 approximately 25 percent of 
farms in Tamil Nadu used little or no irrigation; 
by contrast, 65 percent of farms consisted of 
almost entirely irrigated land.  Only about 10 percent of farms had significant shares (at least 20 
percent) of both irrigated and non-irrigated la
nd.  Thus, agricultural programs that focus on 
irrigated crops will generally not directly bene
fit 25 percent of farm households.  Similarly, 
                                                     
 20 Some of these basins, including the Cauvery,
 are partially located in neighboring states. 
 24programs that focus on non-irrigated crops will gene
rally not directly benefit the 65 percent of 
farm households with essentia
lly no non-irrigated land (

  Rainfed Agriculture 
 3.9 Rainfed agriculture accounts for 45 percent of the gross cultivated area of 6.5 million 
hectares in Tamil Nadu and approximately 25 percent of farmers in the state are engaged in 
rainfed agriculture. Despite its importance as a source of income and employment, productivity 
in rainfed agriculture has been low. Tamil 
Nadu has implemented a number of centrally 
sponsored and donor funded watershed devel
opment schemes aimed at improving the production 
potential of rainfed agriculture. These schemes 
include the Drought Prone Areas Programme 
(DPAP), the National Watershed Developmen
t Project for Rainfed Areas (NWDPRA), the 
Integrated Wasteland Development Pr
ogramme (IWDP) and the DANIDA funded Comprehensive Watershed Development Projects.  
3.10 The DPAP implemented in Tamil Nadu since 
the early 1970s promotes natural resource 
management in watersheds so as to mitigate th
e adverse effects of drought, prevent further 
degradation and generate empl
oyment through non-farm activities. IWDP has the broad 
 25objectives of sustainability, equity and environm
ental conservation to meet timber, fodder and 
fuel needs and to increase employment opportun
ities for Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes and 
other socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This
 program has been implemented in the state 
since 1993/94 in non-DPAP blocks. NWDPRA focu
ses on sustainable production of biomass and 
restoration of ecological balance in watershe
ds and has been operational since 1990-91. This 
initiative has recently been restru
ctured into the Watershed Areas Rainfed Agricultural Systems 
Approach  (WARASA). All of these programs are jointly funded by the Central government and 
GoTN, with the center responsible for at least 75 percent of the costs. 
3.11 The recently launched Comprehensive Wasteland Programme is a major initiative 
promoted by the GoTN which holds potential 
for improving water productivity in rainfed 
lands.  The program aims to reclaim current fallow wastelands through a micro watershed 
development program focusing on 
soil and water conservation. 
Roughly 17 percent of Tamil 
Nadu™s land area is classified as wastelands.
21 The program has two main components.  The first 
promotes participatory watershed 
development of  patta lands.
22  The second component seeks to 
encourage development of government owned wast
elands by corporate houses, small companies, 
cooperatives and Federations of Women™s Self Help Groups.  
3.12 Farmers participating in the participatory wa
tershed approach will receive a subsidy to 
partially cover costs for planting and irrigating 
horticultural and agro-forestry crops such as 
mangoes, cashew, sapota, tamarind, neem, silk 
cotton in the watersheds. The involvement of 
corporations in wasteland development will be
 encouraged by offering 30 year leases for 
wastelands of up to 1,000 acres to corporations that
 are interested in raising horticultural crops or 
bio-mass plantations on wastelands. Corpora
tions leasing land under this program will pay 
concessional amounts of rent proportional to land value for use of the land.   
3.13 Although watershed projects have been widely promoted throughout India the 
success of these projects in terms of curbing 
land degradation, improvi
ng the productivity of rainfed agriculture and reducing rural poverty has been limited
.  Reviews of watershed 
development programs in India have found that
 successful approaches to watershed development 
have entailed extensive community participation with sound technical inputs. The evidence also 
reveals that benefits of these projects have b
een skewed towards landowners, with landless people 
benefiting indirectly.  In some cases women and 
landless may have actually been made worse off 
as their access to common property resources may be restricted as a result of  project 
interventions. Adequately addressing these equity 
issues remains a challenge for governments and 
NGOs involved with implementing watershed projects.
 It has also been found that subsidies for 
soil and water conservation, and the opportuniti
es for employment, can induce farmers to accept 
soil conservation strategies that they do not really want and are hence difficult to sustain in the 

long run once the project ends (Kerr et al, 2002). 
 Tailoring conservation strategies to practices 
that farmers really want will be important in 
ensuring the success and long run sustainability of 
future initiatives.  For programs such as the Comprehensive Wasteland Programme, it is also 
important that the state adopts a basin perspective in implementation to ensure that these 
initiatives do not have negative impact
s on downstream human and ecological uses
.    3.14 Rainwater harvesting is being promoted on a large scale in the state in an effort to 
supplement ground water resources
. As much of the rainfall is received in a very short period, 
                                                     
 21 Wastelands include barren and uncultivable land, cultivable waste, permanent pastures and other grazing 
lands, other fallow lands, 50 per cent of current fallows and 40 per cent of dry land. 
 22 Private lands where owners are issued a Patta Pass Book 
 26rain water harvesting offers the ability to capture
 a transitory resource and can provide sufficient 
water to grow less water-intensive crops.
23 In urban areas, rainwater harvesting is a potential 
source of water for consumption purposes.  As of
 July, 2003, the Government of Tamil Nadu has 
passed an ordinance requiring all buildings in the state to install rainwater harvesting structures 
before the monsoon.   
 Irrigated Agriculture 
 3.15 Tamil Nadu has a net irrigated area of 3 million hectares (1999/00).  Most irrigated lands 
are only irrigated for a single season and the state™
s irrigation intensity of 121 percent is relatively 
low.24  Today the state is equally reliant on 
surface and groundwater sources for irrigation, although its reliance on groundwater sources has been steadily increasing (
Figure  3.3).  
Approximately 30 percent of the net irrigated ar
ea is irrigated by water from canals.  An 
additional 21 percent is irrigated by tanks, while 
wells are used to irrigate 49 percent of the net 
irrigated area. The remaining area is irrigated by other sources such as streams and springs. Net 

irrigated area has increased by about 10 percen
t in the past two decades from 2.7 million ha in 
1981/82, due mainly to a 39 percent increase in area
 irrigated by wells.  Over the same period, 
area irrigated by canals and tanks decreased 
by approximately 4 percent and 14 percent, 
respectively.

Surface irrigation 
 3.16 Tamil Nadu has constructed more than 85 la
rge and medium dams since independence.  
As the surface irrigation potential has virtually been exhausted, mode
rnizing and rehabilitating 
existing systems is crucial to improve the efficiency of surface irrigation. The majority of canal 
systems in the state are old and have very poor 
efficiency as a result of seepage and silting in the 
canals (GoTN, 2001a).  In recent years the state 
has undertaken some major canal modernization 
projects with the aide of World Bank funding unde
r the Water Resources Consolidation Project.   
                                                      
 23 On average there are 30 rainy days during the southwest monsoon and 55 rainy days during the northeast 
monsoon.   
24 The all-India irrigation intensity is 132%.   
 273.17 In the 1960s, tank irrigation accounted for almost 37 percent of net irrigated area in 
Tamil Nadu. Area irrigated with tanks has steadily 
declined over time, however, because of 
siltation in tank beds and supply 
channels, encroachments in the 
tank bund, foreshore, and supply 
channels, and damaged sluices, weirs and bunds,. There are currently 41,948 tanks in the state of 
TN irrigating an area of 0.63 million hectares, the average area irrigated by a tank is 15.1 ha.  Due 
to water shortages a large number of tanks in the 
state are defunct.  A recent study found that in a 
10 year period, tanks are only full for 2 years, they are partially full for 5 years and fail for 3 out 

of 10 years. Water markets are becoming increasingly important in the tank command areas and 

provide a means to supplement inadequate tank i
rrigation water particularly at the end of the 
paddy season. Farmers normally spend about 20 percent of their rice crop income on buying 

water from well owners.  Since 
only 15 percent of farmers own wells in the tank command, 
demand for supplemental irrigation is high (Palanisami, 2003).   
Groundwater Irrigation  3.18 Factors including rural electrification, the availability of affordable irrigation pump sets 
and cheap or free electricity for agriculture 
have contributed to the increasing reliance on 
groundwater for irrigation in Tamil Nadu.  
Both the number of wells and area irrigated by them 
registered significant increases 
over the years. The number of wells (dug and tube wells) had 
increased from 1.68 million during 1981-82 to 1.83 million in 1999-2000, the area irrigated by them 
rose from 1.05 million ha. to 1.45 million ha. 
 3.19 Overexploitation of groundwater resources 
is a major problem facing the state. Of a total of 1.8 million wells in the state, approxima
tely 10 percent are now defunct. The depth of 
bore wells in hard rock area has increased to 
as much as 600ft to 1000ft.  Today, use of dug wells 
as a source of irrigation is only possible in canal
 and tank command areas; only bore wells remain 
operational in hard rock areas (mainly in the western part of the state).
25  Due to acute water scarcity the Government of Tamil Nadu has recen
tly announced its plans 
to ban the drilling of bore wells, particularly in hard rock areas. This
 however has had a perverse effect as farmers are 
rushing to drill additional wells before the ban 
is officially imposed. Spacing norms have been 
prescribed based on the guidelines issued by 
NABARD (National Bank for Agricultural and 
Rural Development). Dug wells must be at least 150 
m apart; deep tube wells must be at least 600 
m apart. These spacing norms for the construction 
of new structures for minor irrigation purposes 
are applicable throughout the state for wells that
 are constructed with the aide of institutional 
finance. Institutions  3.20 Institutional weaknesses undermined proper management and development of 
water resources in Tamil Nadu
. Institutional arrangements did 
not adequately address water 
resources management, allocation and planning.  
There has also been a lack of expenditure 
prioritization; inadequate priority to and fundi
ng for operations and ma
intenance (O&M) has led to rapid deterioration of surface irrigation. Farm
er involvement in the operation and maintenance 
of irrigation systems has been minimal. Recently, 
however, effort has been made to address many 
of the policy and institutional issues plaguing the water sector.  
3.21 The state is now undertaking 
comprehensive water planning on a river basin basis
 and 
has decentralized water resource management along 
river basins.  The Public Works Department 
has been divided into the 
Water Resources Organization (WRO) 
and the Buildings 
                                                     
 25 Personal communication with K. Palanisami (TNAU). 
 28Organization in 1995.
 The WRO is to be formalized as a separate agency with a specialized cadre 
of staff in 2004.
 Chief Engineers of the WRO have been reorganized along a river basin basis and 
Government Orders setting up the Palar Basin 
Development and Management Board and the 
Thambaraparani Basin Developm
ent and Management Board were issued in January, 2000. 
Preparation of macro-level basin development plans and formulation of decision support systems 
for development and management of the water 
resources of the state has been underway since 
1997.  
3.22 The state has also drafted a Water Policy and steps for irrigation management 
transfer have also been initiated
. The Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems 
Bill was passed  by the State Legislative Assembly 
in May, 2000. The state was one of the first in 
India to pass a Groundwater Regulation and Management Act. Development of requisite skills in 
environmental aspects of water resources for staf
f in specified units of the Public Works 
Department has been a s
ubstantial achievement.  
Irrigation Management Transfer  3.23 Traditionally rural communities have played a 
central role in the management of water 
resources in Tamil Nadu. Informal arrangements 
under the system of ﬁkudimaramathu™ were 
widespread for the maintenance and management 
 of irrigation tanks up until the middle of the 
19th century. Various other spontaneously created fa
rmer organizations also played an important 
part in the management of canal systems, as well.    
3.24 Between 1988 and 1994 as part of the 
Command Area Development Programme, the 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural Engineering Department 
organized Water User Associations in five 
major systems. By 1994, 3,300 outlet level WU
As and 118 distributory canal level WUAs had 
been formed, though most were not functioning well (Brewer et al., 1999).  The motivation for 
formally transferring irrigation management to 
canal irrigation users in the state was largely 
driven by the pressure of maintaining canal syst
ems in a situation of fiscal stress, increasing  
inter-sectoral competition for water resources, 
and advice from the World Bank as part of the 
WRCP project.  3.25 To enable management transfer to farmers, the Tamil Nadu Farmers Management 
of Irrigation  Systems Bill was passed  by the State Legislative Assembly  in May, 2000
.   
This Act will be in force in an area coveri
ng 1.5 million hectares in the system command areas 
under the management and control of WRO.   
3.26 The Tamil Nadu Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems' (FMIS) Bill created a three-
tier system management organization, including WUAs at the outlet, WUAs at the 500 hectare 
command levels and a joint management committe
e(JMC) (a committee including representatives 
of the WUAs and of key government agencies) at the project level.
26  The Bill also allows for the 
full or partial transfer of O&M responsib
ilities to these bodies.  Each WUA has complete 
responsibility for water distributio
n and maintenance in the area 
under its jurisdiction. The JMC 
is afforded the responsibility of deciding on wa
ter allocations and distribution each season and for 
solving problems as they arise.    
3.27 Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and evaluations 
of its impact  in Tamil Nadu are yet to be carri
ed out.  However, there is a growing body of 
evidence on the impact of IMT from other states in 
India which is likely to be relevant for Tamil 
                                                     
 26 The JMC™s are known as Farmer Councils 
 29A recent study undertaken by the International 
Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the 
Gujarat Institute of Development Research (GIDR)
 sheds some important insights into pro-poor 
IMT in large-scale canal irrigation systems.  The 
study is based on a survey of 700 landowning and 
tenant farmers from seven WUA™s in the two states. The study found that IMT in AP and Gujarat 
led to improved access to water for 15% and 25
% of farmers surveyed and extension of the 
irrigated area for 2% and 3% of farmers in the tw
o states, respectively. Ho
wever, the authors also 
find that poor farmers are less 
informed about their rights and tend to loose out on many of the 
potential benefits of IMT.   
 The report makes the following recommendations in terms of making IMT more pro-poor.   
 1. The rights of farmers need to
 be clearly defined.  Individual farmers within the WUA 
should have equal decision making power regardless of farm size. 
2. The awareness of poor farmers and access to 
information on the IMT process should be 
raised.  Differences in access to information 
between poor and wealthy farmers contribute 
to inequities. Wealthy farmers tend to be better informed of their rights and 

responsibilities as WUA members and participate more in the decision-making processes.  

Small farmers were more likely to be unaware 
of the existence of WUAs.  The absence of 
small farmers from committee and general mee
tings means that they are excluded from 
key decisions taken within the WUA including decisions on the use of funds, site 

selection for R&R (Resettlement and Rehabilitation), future self-management of water 
distribution etc.  
3. The election process within the WUA should be
 competitive and transparent.  Election of 
new presidents and committee 
members should be vote-based rather than consensus-
based, to promote competition between several candidates. 
4. The levels of participation (in WUA elections, decision-making processes, fee collection 

etc) by farm size and location should be monitored.. Farm size has proven to be a good 
indicator of relative wealth and monitoring 
participation by farm size provides a good 
indicator of equity trends.

(Text Box  3.1).

Water and Electricity Charges 
 3.28 Tamil Nadu has an extremely complicated system of water charges for surface 
irrigation compared to most Indian states
.  Currently there are 188 water rates  (133 for wet 
lands and 55 for dry lands) for farmers depe
nding on soil type, irrigation source, crop grown, 
season etc. Currently water rates  form part of 
the land revenue collected from farmers by village 
administrative officers.  Apart from the basic wa
ter rate there is a local cess and a local cess 
surcharge levied as a multiple of the basic water ra
te paid by farmers.  The revenue from the local 
cess and local cess surcharge is transferred to Panchayat bodies for general expenditures.  
3.29 At present the revenue department is involve
d in both assessments of water charges and 
collection.  The VAOs (village officials) are supposed to inspect the field and record the cropped area, the area under government sources of irrigati
on (e.g. canals, tanks, etc.) and crop conditions. 
A sample check is conducted by higher officials such as the Revenue Inspector/Deputy Tasildars.  
 30At the end of the agricultural year (fasli year),
 the accounts are prepared and water charges are 
collected along with the land revenue.  The my
riad of water rates provide considerable 
discretionary power to assessors.   
 3.30 Until recent revisions, water rates had been untouched since 1962
. Beginning in July 
2003, however, an additional water charge of Rs
 150/ha ,de-linked from any additional cess, was 
imposed.  Thus the farmer will pay the original ch
arge plus the Rs 150/ha.  In addition, the FMIS 
Act empowers the water users™ associations to ch
arge users between Rs 250/ha to Rs 500/ha.  
This additional charge can be retained by the 
WUA for operation and maintenance of the systems 
turned over to them. 

 
3.31 In 1999/00 total O&M expenditures on irriga
tion amounted to Rs 45.6 Crores.  Total 
revenue collected was roughly Rs 11 Crores. Henc
e cost recovery was less than 25 percent (

 3.32 Low water charges and poor cost recovery
 has meant that canal irrigation users 
have received an implicit subsidy
. In 2000/01 the implicit irrigation subsidy (defined as the 
difference between O&M expenditures and actual co
llection of water charges) amounted to Rs 
333.5 million. Based on an estimated gross canal 
irrigated area of 0.87 million hectares this 
translates into a per hectare subsidy of  Rs 649.
27 3.33 The vast majority of rural households in Tamil Nadu do not benefit directly from 
canal irrigation subsidies; in fact only 7 percent of rural households (15 percent of 
households cultivating crops) enjoy these implicit subsidies
.  However, the distribution of 
canal irrigation subsidies among households that use canal irrigation is less regressive than in 

other major Indian states (World Bank, 2003a). 
In Tamil Nadu over 90 percent of farmers using 
canal irrigation are marginal and small farmers and these farmers capture approximately 76 
                                                     
 27 Exact data on gross canal irrigated area are not available.  Gross canal irrigated area is computed as the 
net canal irrigated area multiplied by the intensity of irrigation  (1.2062). 
 31percent of the canal irrigation subsidy. The aver
age subsidy received by households using canal 
irrigation in 2000/01 was Rs 493.67.  Owing to larg
er farm sizes, large farmers enjoy average 
subsidies that are more than four times as large 
as those enjoyed by marginal and small farmers  
(Table  3.4).

Agricultural Power Tariffs 
 3.34 Until recently farmers pumping groundwater 
for irrigation with the use of electric 
pump sets have benefited 
from free electricity.  Free electricity for agricultural consumers 
coupled with irrigators not internalizing the envi
ronmental costs of their 
water use, has reduced 
incentives for conservation (encouraging over ex
traction of groundwater) and encouraged the 
cultivation of water-intensive crops. Provision of 
free electricity for agricultural power consumers 
has also contributed to the deteriorating finances of the state™s power sector affecting the 
economy™s growth and fiscal health.   
3.35 In Tamil Nadu, as in the rest of India, the electricity tariff charged from industrial and commercial consumers cross-subsidizes 
domestic and agricultural consumers
.  This policy has contributed to rapid expansion in consumption from subsidized categories and 
stagnation in consumption from subsidizing cat
egories (World Bank, 2003).  Industries, 
commercial users and even many domestic consumers 
have had to make large investments in self 
generation capability which is highly inefficient.
  This, along with the cross subsidy, has an 
impact on the competitiveness of the state™s industries and economy.  Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Board™s financial distress has contained its ab
ility to make investments, resulting in uneven 
quality of supply and generation shortages.  
3.36 Apart from these environmental and fiscal issues, the distribution of power 
subsidies to farmers is also a concern, since 
the subsidy reaches only the 16 percent of Tamil 
Nadu farmers who own pump sets. The vast majority of rural households have not benefited 
directly from agricultural power subsidies because they do not own electric pump sets. The 
majority of electric pump set owners are small and marginal farmers (79.4 percent), 14 percent 
are medium farmers and 6 percent are large farmers (
Table  3.5). 
28  It is important to note, 
                                                     
 28 Households that reported cultivating crops and own le
ss than 1 hectare (Ha) were classified as marginal 
farmers, those owning 1 to less than 2 Ha were classi
fied as small farmers, those with 2 and less than 4 Ha 
are classified as medium farmers.  Households owning 
4 or more hectares are classified as large farmers. 
 32though, that insufficient new investment and main
tenance have made rural electric supply erratic 
in many places.  Surveys in other states in Indi
a indicate that farmers would be willing to pay for 
electricity, provided that it was more reliable (World Bank, 2001). 
 3.37 In 2001/2002 agricultural power consumers 
in Tamil Nadu received a subsidy of Rs 
27.09 billion.29 According to available data, total official power consumption by agricultural 
consumers was 9,484 million Kwh and the average 
cost of supplying power to farmers was Rs 
3.05/Kwh. Although small and marginal farmers c
onstitute the majority of electric pump set 
owners in Tamil Nadu, medium and large farm
ers (representing 21 percent of all agricultural 
pump set owners) receive a disproportionately larg
e share of the total agricultural power subsidy 
compared to their representation in the population 
(i.e. while medium and large farmers represent 
21% of electric pumpset owners, they operate 
48 percent of the area irrigated by electric pump 
sets) (Table  3.5).30 Poor rural households in Tamil Nadu receive less than 17% of the agricultural 
power subsidy.  Table

  3.38 In March 2003, The Tamil Nadu Electrici
ty Regulatory Commission (TNERC) 
notified its first tariff order, reducing the cross-subsidy on electricity with the introduction 
of an agricultural tariff
.  After 12 years of free power to farmers, the new tariff order has 
introduced a flat rate for unmetered connections
 of Rs.250 per HP per annum and a charge of 
Rs.0.20/kWh for metered connections. The gove
rnment also announced an income support 
scheme for small and marginal farmers.  This was 
a significant step toward creating a more direct 
and transparent system of subsidies to farmers a
nd other target groups and ensuring the separation

 30 The analysis of agricultural power subsidies in 
Tamil Nadu presented is based on data from the 54
th round (1998) of the Indian National Sample Survey (NSS).
 30 This round of the NSS
 included a module on 
Common Property Resources, Sanitation and Hygiene whic
h contained information on cultivation practices 
of households, and the ownership and use of irrigation technology (electric pumps, diesel pumps, canals, 
and conjunctive sources) in
 cultivating five principal crops. By 
using the amount of area irrigated by 
electric pumps as a proxy for the benefits of subsidized
 electricity, these data can be used to examine the 
distribution of agricultural power subsidies across vari
ous landholding categories. In reality, in addition to 
farm size, power consumption by different groups of farmers is likely to depend on the water requirements 
of crops grown, the depth of the water table, and 
the availability, reliability and quality of the power 
supply. The magnitude of agricultural power subsidies goin
g to different land holding categories can be 
estimated by combining data on the ownership of electric pump sets, the distribution of area irrigated by 
electric pumps by land holding, and an estimat
e of the total agricultural power subsidy. 
 33of commercial operation of the power utility fr
om the need for subsidy. However, the 
reintroduction of agriculture power tariff became
 a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu during 
the recent national election, forcing the governme
nt which suffered severe electoral loss for the 
national parliament seats to reverse the policy. 
 3.39 Under the income support scheme, GoTN 
provided small and marginal farmers a 
transfer of up to Rs.1250 per year.  However, this disbursement 
was restricted to Rs.1000 in the case of small and marginal farmers owning pump sets of 3 HP capacity.   These farmers, 0.94 
million, accounted for about 57% of the agricultural 
connections or 12% of farmers.  This direct 
subsidy would have amounted to 
about Rs.1 billion for farmers. 
3.40 On June 10, 2003,  the Central government 
enacted the Electricity Act 2003 (Act) which 
replaces the earlier central laws on electricity viz. the Indian Electricity Act-1910, Electricity 

Supply Act-1948, and the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act of 1998. The new act is 

expected to have a far reaching impact on the 
power sector in India (World Bank, 2003).  The 
provision for mandatory metering of supply of el
ectricity within two years will put pressure on 
States to meter agricultural consumers.  TNEB has started metering new agriculture connections 

since July 1, 2002.  Like rest of India, mete
ring the 1.65 million existing agricultural consumers 
in the state is politically challenging, and is exp
ected to take time.  However 100% metering is a 
mandatory requirement under the Act and an essential
 pre-requisite to improve the information on 
power supply and consumption.  
 Full metering of retail consump
tion along with bulk metering is 
also required to establish energy accountability among utility staff.  Metering of agriculture 

would be the first step towards better targeting of the agriculture subsidy based on actual 

consumption and provide better incentives for effi
cient usage of scarce water resources in Tamil 
Nadu.    The Impact of  Water, Agricultural Power 
and Fertilizer Subsidies on Incentives in TN 
Agriculture  3.41 Government policies have major effects on crop profitability in India
.  Trade policies (tariffs, export subsidies, and quantitative restric
tions) affect domestic market prices of local  
commodities that compete with international goods. 
 Moreover, agricultural-related subsidies (the 
national fertilizer subsidy, inadequate cost recove
ry in irrigation systems, electricity subsidies) 
and investments involve major public expenditures.     
3.42 In order to examine the impacts of major 
policies on incentives in agriculture, this 
section presents measures of crop profitability wi
th and without subsidies and other market 
distortions.  Given the importance of increasing water e
fficiency in agriculture, a major focus of 
the analysis is on the effects of changes in irriga
tion costs (water charges in canals and electricity 
charges for wells).  The impact of other major 
policies is also considered through estimates of 
crop productivity at economic prices (i.e. at pr
ices that reflect the opportunity cost of each 
resource).   3.43 The analysis is based on costs of cultiva
tion and crop budgets (average of 1999/2000 and 2000/01) as calculated from farmer surveys by th
e Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) 
for selected crops and sites.  These sites are chosen as representative of each crop under the 
irrigation system specified.  It should be noted th
at costs and returns of individual farmer fields 
depend on particular soil conditions
, local rainfall, farm management skills, and other factors.   
3.44 The amount of water used and its margin
al (operational) cost varies considerably 
across types of irrigation and crops
 (Table  3.6).  Sugar cane requires the most water (1800 
mms/unit area) and occupies the land essentially y
ear-round.  Paddy requires 135 mms/unit area 
in only 4 months. Cotton and groundnuts require le
ss than half the water of paddy.  Financial 
 34costs of irrigation to the farmer (not including capital costs) vary from about 289 Rs/ha for paddy 
under canal irrigation
31 to 1,250 Rs/ha (the annual tax on a 5 horsepower pump set) for sugar 
cane and banana.  (Pump set taxes for crops that
 are grown as part of a two-crop sequence are 
estimated as one half of the annual charges for pump sets, i.e. 625 Rs/ha.)  
3.45 Estimates of the full marginal cost of 
irrigation under meter charges vary more 
substantially, given the large variation in estimated electricity use
.  Electricity use for paddy 
irrigated solely with pumps is more than five 
times that of paddy irri
gated by tanks with only 
supplemental irrigation from pumps.  Likewise, est
imated electricity use for groundnut and cotton 
irrigation by pumps is only about half that for 
paddy given lesser water requirements.  Estimated 
economic costs of irrigation (excluding capital co
sts) for paddy irrigated by wells is about 10 
times the estimated economic costs of canal irriga
tion (4600 Rs/ha for pumps compared with 450 
Rs/ha for canals).32   3.46 Given variations in costs as well as value of
 output, net financial returns per hectare of rice, sugar cane, cotton and groundnuts unde
r various forms of irrigation range from 
9,849 Rs/ha for rice cultivation under tank and well irrigation to 17,956 Rs/ha for sugar 
cane with well irrigation (Table  3.7). These costs and financial returns of cultivation for irrigation with pumps are adjusted to include the tax on electric motors which is planned to take 
effect in late 2003.        
3.47 For well irrigation, the tax on pumpsets (a
djusted for the number of crops grown on 
the land) is equal to only 4.9 to 6.5 percent of
 net returns to land and management with no 
irrigation costs.  These figures represent the reduction in 
crop profitability in these systems if no 
direct payments are given to offset the new tax 
on pumpsets.  If a system of meters is used and 
electricity costs remain at 0.2 Rs/kw-hr, then elect
ricity charges as a percentage of returns to land 
and management with no irrgation costs actually falls to 0.8 to 2.3 percent.   

3.48 However, if electricity char
ges are raised to the estima
ted marginal economic price 
of electricity to agriculture of  3.05 Rs/Kwhr,
 electricity costs rise to about 4,600 Rs/ha for 
paddy and sugar cane, reducing returns to 
land and management by 35.9 percent for rice 
and 23.8 percent for sugar cane
.  Likewise, total returns to land,
 labor and capital (value added) 
falls sharply for paddy and sugar cane irrigated by
 wells when the cost of electricity for pumping 
is included.  If electricity is costed at its 
economic price, total income generated from cotton 
cultivation (23,949 Rs/ha) is 53 percent greater than that for rice.33   3.49 Full cost of electricity for pumping woul
d thus reduce profitability per hectare of 
rice in favor of cotton, groundnuts and other l
ess water-intensive crops
 (for which costs and 
returns are not calculated here).
  This does not imply that all, or even most of the land planted 
to rice would shift to these crops.  For example, 
current cotton area irrigated with wells is only 
about 62 thousand hectares, compared with an estimated 202 thousand hectares of rice irrigated 
with wells, but cotton may not be suited to all 
the rice land, because of drainage and other soil 
characteristics.  Marketing problems might slow shifts to other crops, as well.  Nonetheless, 

charging full cost for electricity would seriously
 change the incentives for rice production, and 
                                                     
 31 Canal water charges are those for the Cauvery delta. 
32 For pumps, the economic cost of el
ectricity is assumed to be 3.1 Rs
/kw-hour.  For can
als, the economic 
cost of water is assumed to be 450 Rs/ha.  Note that
 these figures do not include the cost of capital of the 
pumps, however. 
33 Note that if the farmer hires outside labor or rents the land, farm income will be less than total value 
added. 
 35promote water conservation. Water thus saved w
ould be available for more productive uses either 
in agriculture, for household consumption, or industrial use.

 37 3.50 Fertilizer is also subsidized: farmer prices of urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and 
potash (K20) are 33, 5 and 48 percent below estimated border prices, respectively.
34  These 
subsidies significantly affect profitability: estimated
 fertilizer subsidies per hectare range are 810 
to 914 Rs/hectare for paddy and 2408 Rs/hectare for s
ugar cane (Table 3.8), equivalent to 6.6 to 
9.3 percent of net financial returns for paddy a
nd 13.4 percent of net fina
ncial returns for sugar 
cane. 3.51 Total input subsidies (both irrigation and f
ertilizer) thus account for 32.0 percent of 
net financial returns (calculated with a flat rate
 cost of electricity/irrigation) of sugar cane 
and 39.2 percent of net financial returns to paddy under well irrigation.
  The share of total input subsidy for other crops is much smaller: (9
.5 to 15.2 percent).  Net returns for cotton and 
groundnuts at economic prices of fertilizer and 
water are about 13,600 Rs/hectare, 1.9 times higher than those of paddy cultivated with well i
rrigation and 1.27 times higher than sugar cane. 
3.52 Current charges for irrigation (electricity co
sts) for paddy cultivated with tubewells 
in Tamil Nadu (Rs 625/ha) are less than irrigatio
n costs per hectare of paddy cultivated in 
other major rice producing states in India (Figure 3.4).
  These electricity costs are only two-
thirds average irrigation costs in Andhra Pradesh and 45 percent of irrigation costs in Punjab.  If 
full costs of irrigation were charged for tubewells, in Tamil Nadu (Rs 4,625/ha) , however, these 
costs would be 2.3 and 3.4 times the irrigation cost
s per hectare of paddy cultivated in Punjab and 
Haryana, respectively.   
3.53 Comparisons of gross profits per hectare of rice cultivation between Tamil Nadu 
and other states nonetheless suggest that there 
is ample scope for a moderate increase in 
electricity charges.
  Gross profits per hectare of rice cu
ltivation using C1 costs (i.e. returns to 
land and management) for Tamil Nadu (well irri
gation) are 5.3 percent higher than the AP 
average.  Charging a flat rate cost for electri
city/pump makes returns for TN/wells essentially 
equal to average returns for AP (12,261 vs 12,242 Rs/ha).  Charging full irrigation/electricity 
costs for TN/wells reduces returns to 8260 Rs/ha, comparable to West Bengal (8,279 Rs/ha).
35                                                      
 34 Border prices of fertilizer are calculated using 
the 2010 World Bank Commodity forecasts for world 
prices (expressed in 2002 prices) and the December 
2002 nominal exchange rate.  Freight and marketing 
costs are from Gulati and Narayanan (2003, Table A3.2).   
35 Yields in Tamil Nadu are below those of AP and Punjab (4.0-4.1 tons/ha versus 4.8 and 5.1 tons/ha), but 
average output price in Tamil Nadu is 
higher than AP (5.9 vs 5.5 Rs/kg) and especially Punjab (4.8 Rs/kg).  
Varietal differences account for some 
of the price difference.  Note that measures of financial returns are 
greatly influenced by output prices and yields which may vary from year to year.

  Technology  3.54 The prevailing water scarcity in Tamil Nadu has provided impetus for the adoption 
of drip and sprinkler irrigation technology
. Today the state along with Maharashtra is one of 
the leading adopters of drip irrigation technology in India.  In 2002, 72,816 hectares in Tamil 
Nadu (slightly more than 1 percent of net sown
 area) was cultivated under drip and sprinkler 
irrigation (GoTN, Agriculture Policy Note, 2003-04).  These water-saving technologies are 
primarily used for horticultural, fruit and flow
er crops including Coconut, Grapes, Banana, 
Cashew, Citrus, Guava, Mango, Pomegranate, Sa
pota. The potential water savings from the use 
of drip irrigation as opposed to conventional well 
irrigation have been estimated to be large, 
ranging from 39 percent for tomatoes to as much as 68 percent for papaya  (Muthuchamy, 
Palanisami and Rajagoapl, 2000).  The government 
is also trying to promote the use of drip 
irrigation for sugar cane cultivated under private mills. 
 3.55 The cost of  a micro-irrigation system depends on the crop, spacing, water 
requirements and the distance from the water source
. The cost of installing drip irrigation is 
estimated to range from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 
per hectare for wide spaced crops such as coconut and mangos to Rs 60,000 to 75,000 for cl
ose spaced crops such as sugarcane, cotton, 
vegetables etc.     The high capital cost of dr
ip irrigation poses a constraint to widespread 
 40adoption by marginal and small fa
rmers although the use of this technology has been encouraged 
though the provision of centrally funded subsidies to farmers. 
Environmental Management 
 3.56 An environmental action plan (EAP) has been drawn up with the aim of fully 
integrating environmental management in pl
anning, investment and management of the State's water resources
. A key element of the EAPs was 
to strengthen WRO's environmental 
monitoring and analysis capabilities via the creati
on of specialist Environmental Units/Cells. Two 
such units have been established in the main pl
anning departments (basin- and project-level).

  414. Public Expenditures and Agricultural Extension Public Expenditures on Agriculture and Irrigation 
 4.1 Agriculture related public expenditures in
 Tamil Nadu (expenditures on agriculture 
and allied activities and irrigation) as a share of agricultural GSDP are higher than most 
major agricultural states in India (World Bank, 2003b)
. These expenditures (both capital and 
revenue) totaled Rs 17 Billion in 2002/03. Be
tween 1998-2000 agricultural expenditures have 
accounted for approximately 11 percent of to
tal Agricultural GSDP in Tamil Nadu; the 
comparable figure across Indian states was 7.8 percent.
36 In Tamil Nadu agriculture related 
capital expenditures are relatively low compared 
to the all-India average, although revenue 
expenditures as a share of Agricultural GSDP 
are significantly higher than most major 
agricultural states in India. This is a situation 
for concern since capital investments are important 
for future growth, furthermore a large share of 
revenue expenditures are incurred on staff salaries 
and the food and irrigation subsidies 
leaving operating expenses under funded. 
4.2 In 2002 capital expenditures on agriculture and allied activities and irrigation 
accounted for 4.3 percent and 13.5 percent of the total capital outlay of  Rs 22.1 billion in 

Tamil Nadu, respectively
.  Of a total revenue expenditure of Rs 268.62 billion approximately 5 
percent  (Rs 13.02 billion) was spent on agricultu
re and allied activities and 1.5 percent was spent 
on irrigation and flood control (Rs 3.96 billion)
. Total expenditures (capital and revenue 
expenditures) on agriculture and allied activities 
during the 1990s exhibited a slight downward 
trend with an average annual growth rate of Œ1.1 percent while total expenditures on irrigation 
have grown at an average annual rate of 6.2 percent (
Figure  4.1:). Gross capital formation in 
agriculture increased by 15 percent in during th
e 1990s and this growth was primarily due to 
private capital formation which grew by almost
 16 percent between 1989/90  and  1998/99.

      4.3 During the 1990s, the share of agricultura
l and allied expenditures devoted to crop 
husbandry has declined, while expenditures on
 animal husbandry, dairy development and 
agricultural research and education have increased
. In 2001 expenditures on crop husbandry 
represented the single largest category of e
xpenditures on agricultural and allied activities accounting for approximately 45 percent of expenditures (
Table  4.1).  Expenditures on animal 
husbandry, dairy development and agricultural resear
ch and education averaged  8.8 percent, 3.2 
percent and 7.1 percent of total expenditures on agriculture and allied activities, respectively. 
Real expenditures on crop husbandry have decrease
d by an average annual rate of 2.4 percent 
during the 1990s, while expenditures on dairy de
velopment, agricultural research and education 
and irrigation have increased by an average annual 
rate of 12 percent, 4.2 percent and 6 percent, 
respectively.

  43Tamil Nadu™s Public Distribution System  4.4 Tamil Nadu™s Targeted Public Distribution Sy
stem (TPDS) is one the  central pillars of the state™s strategy to ensure food security
.  Under the TPDS, eligible households can purchase 
a specified amount of  food grains and other essential commodities at subsidized prices from a 
network of public distribution outlets, known as Fa
ir Price shops, throughout the state.  Of the 18 
GoI essential commodities, four commodities na
mely, rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene are 
supplied through the public distribution system (PDS) in TN.  Ooty tea and Iodised salt are also 

sold through the PDS in the state. Beginning in July 2002, TN introduced some significant 
reforms to its PDS to address fiscal concerns 
the main elements of which included a coupon 
system to eliminate leakages, decentralized procur
ement, and restructuring of the issue price of 
rice.   4.5 Although substantive PDS reforms were undert
aken between 2002 to 2003, these reforms 
have recently suffered a setback. Rice coupons 
introduced to reduce the number of households 
eligible for PDS rice have been abolished by th
e GoTN after the national election in April-May 
2004. Income criteria to determine PDS e
ligibility have also been withdrawn. 
4.6 Coverage of TPDS in Tamil Nadu has been significantly higher than in the majority of 
Indian states.  In 1999/00 85 percent of BPL house
holds in Tamil Nadu were estimated to use the 
TPDS, a 14% increase since 1993/94.  The propor
tion of APL households accessing TPDS is also 
high in Tamil Nadu with approximately 66%
 of APL households accessing TPDS shops in 
1999/00 (Deininger, Umali-Deininger and Tritah, 2003). 

4.7 Under the TPDS system operating in TN (t
hrough August 2003), households had the option 
of  drawing rice from the PDS or additional quantitie
s of sugar or kerosene in lieu of rice.  Based 
on the family™s choice, a different colored 
family card is issued.  As of March 2003, 
approximately 16 million family cards had been i
ssued in the state of which 84.7 percent were 
rice cards (pink cards), 8.1 percent were kerosen
e cards (yellow cards), 7 percent were sugar 
cards (yellow cards) and 0.2 percent were kero
sene cards issued to police (khaki cards). 
Approximately 4.6 percent of households in the 
state qualified under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana 
(AAY), a scheme sponsored by the Government of India which targets the poorest households in 
the state enabling them to draw food grains at 
a specially subsidized ra
te specified by GoI. 
4.8 As part of its reform efforts the GoTN ha
d attempted to reduce the number of bogus cards 
that had come into circulation in the state by introducing a coupon system for drawing rice from 

the PDS. Twelve million rice card holders were 
issued coupons. Coupons were only issued to the 
person whose photograph has been affixed to th
e family card. The coupon as well as the family 
card were needed to withdraw rice.   
4.9 Each rice cardholder was entitled to draw 
a specified quantity from the PDS system depending on their family size
.  The maximum monthly issue amount was 20 Kgs for a family 
with ﬁ3 or more unitsﬂ. 37 Families that opted for a yellow card were eligible for an additional 3 
Kgs of sugar or 5 litres of kerosene per month in lieu 
of rice.  In the Nilgiris district, card holders were entitled to an additional 4 Kgs of rice per 
month in addition to the normal entitlement.  All 
AAY households were eligible to draw 35Kgs of rice per month irrespective of family size.   
4.10 Family cardholders in the city and district headquarters could draw 10 Kg of wheat and 
those in rural areas could draw 5Kg each month 
in addition to the rice entitlement.  Each family 
cardholder was also eligible to receive 500 gram
s per head up to a maximum of 2 Kgs per card 
per month.  Those who opted for yellow cards we
re entitled to an additional 3 Kg of sugar per

  44month in addition to their regular entitlement. Ke
rosene was supplied to cardholders on the basis 
of the number of LPG connections they had and wa
s also supplied to some public institutions and 
hospitals through the PDS system.   
4.11 Food grains in the public distribution system are sold to the public through a network of 
Fair price shops that are run by the TN Civil S
upplies Corporation. Private traders are not allowed 
to operate these shops. Each revenue village has a 
fair price shop and the government™s policy is 
to try to ensure that no card holder should  have
 to walk more than 2 km to reach a fair price 
shop.  There is an additional stipulation that th
e maximum number of cards attached to a shop 
should not exceed 800 in urban areas and 500 in rural 
areas.  In very remote areas, or areas where 
the existing fair price shops has to serve more 
than the maximum stipulated number of family 
cards, women™s groups are allowed to distribute PDS commodities. 
4.12 The PDS rice requirement is met through allotm
ents made by the GoI (allotment from the 
Central Pool) and paddy procurement within th
e state. In October 2002 the state adopted a 
decentralized procurement system under whic
h the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation 
procures rice on behalf of FCI at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the GoI.  TNCSC 
procures paddy by opening Direct Purchase Centr
es in the Cauvery Delta Area and through taluk 
godowns in other areas, on behalf of the GoI. The pa
ddy that is procured is  converted into rice by 
the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, stored 
in its godowns and issued in the PDS outlets.  
TNCSC adheres to the  quality norms of FCI a
nd the paddy procured by the state may be re-
allotted to the state as part of the GoI allotment to the state.  The difference between the central 
issue price and the economic cost of rice (set by 
GoI) is reimbursed to the state for the central 
pool allocation of rice. If the quantity procured falls short of the allocation from the central pool 

the balance will be allocated from the central pool 
and if the quantity procured is in excess of the 
requirement for the PDS it will be taken over to the central pool. 
4.13 In 2002/03 the GoI allocation to the state was 495 thousand tons per month.  The 
allocation varies by month and the allocation from th
e central pool is more than adequate to meet 
the requirement of rice under the PDS .  The ce
ntral issue price of rice under TPDS is Rs. 5.65 
per kg of BPL rice and Rs. 8.30 per kg for  APL rice.  The GOI also allows states to charge an 
additional 50 paise per kg to cover costs of trans
portation, storage cost etc.  The economic price 
of rice  obtained by the TN CSC is approximately Rs 12 per kg. As of October 1, 2002 the state 
has adopted a two tier-pricing system for issuing rice whereby the first 10 kgs of rice is sold for 
Rs 3.50 per kg,  any amount above 10 kg is sold for Rs 6 per kg.  The PDS issue price of rice for 

AAY families is Rs 3 per kg.   4.14 Sugar required for the PDS is met out of the 
allotment of levy sugar by the GoI and by 
purchases of non-levy sugar from Tamil Nadu Co-ope
rative Sugar Federation.  For Kerosene the 
state is restricted to the allocation made by th
e GoI.  GoI supplies APL wheat to Tamil Nadu at 
Rs 6.10 per kg.  As of July 2002, TN has been
 selling this wheat though its PDS system at Rs 
7.50 per kg.  The retail price of sugar issued through the PDS was  Rs 13.50 per kg.  If the state 
has to procure non-levy sugar to meet requirements,
 the state government has to bear the costs.  
The issue price of kerosene was Rs 8.40-Rs 9 pe
r litre.  GoI recommends that the issue price 
under the PDS should be between Rs 9-Rs 9.60. 
 The difference in cost is met by the GoTN. 
4.15 As a result of the reforms of the pub
lic procurement system, the GOTN had 
estimated that the food subsidy would be 
dramatically reduced from Rs.1500 crore in 
2001/02 to projected Rs.700 crore in 2003/04, a reduction of Rs. 800 crore
.  Cessation of local 
procurement (except on behalf of the FCI) reduced government expenditures on procurement by 
eliminating the costs of the extra procurement in
centives paid and the costs of milling the paddy 
into rice.  State procurement of paddy in 
2000/01 and 2001/02 were 2.
61 and 1.24 million tons, 
respectively, (equivalent to 1.75 and 0.83 million t
ons of rice).  For this procurement the paid 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  45incentives and ﬁincidental chargesﬂ of Rs. 350 to 
400 per ton (a bonus of about 7.2 percent of the 
GOI procurement price of fine rice).  In total, these costs were approximately Rs 101 crore in 
2000/01 and Rs 50 crore in 2001/02 (Table 4.2).  
4.16 The bulk of the savings on food subsidies, however, were achieved through 
reduction in number of cards (and ultimately the sales of rice), and in the subsidy per 
kilogram of rice sold
.  Total ration sales dropped from 2.10 million tons in 2000/01 to 1.62 
million tons in 2002/03.   In addition the unit s
ubsidy paid by the GOTN fell by 64 percent from 
Rs. 5.13 /kg to Rs/ 1.85 as the average sales price 
rose from Rs 3.0/kg to an
 estimated Rs 4.07/kg, 
and the average cost of rice from the GOI fell 
from Rs 8.13/kg to Rs. 5.92/kg.  (This reduction in 
the average cost was due to an increase in the a
llocation of BPL rice and a lowering of the cost of APL rice.)  Thus, the    reduction in the subsidy 
due to reforms in distribution was about Rs 7.79 
billion (Rs 779 crore).  The total estimated reduction in subsidy (combined 
effect of reforms on 
procurement and distribution) was thus about 
Rs. 8.80 billion (Rs 880 crore), (Table 4.3). 
4.17 Effective 1 September 2003, the two-tiered pricing of rice according to the amount of 
ration purchased was scheduled to e
nd, with the entire ration to be so
ld at Rs. 3.5/kg.  As a result, 
if the quantity sold through ration shops remains at an average of 135 thousand tons per month, 
revenues will fall (and the subsidy will incr
ease) by Rs 0.93 billion (Rs 93 crore or about $21 
million), equivalent to 11 percent of the total s
ubsidy reduction of Rs. 8.
80 billion, shown above.  
If quantity of rice sold per card rises to 16 kgs/
card, the increase in costs relative to 2002/03 
would be Rs. 3.74 crore (about $84 million). The 
implications of the most recent policy reforms 
following the national election in April-Ma
y 2004 remain to be examined.   
Agricultural Extension  4.18 The agricultural extension system in TN is still organized around a modified 
Training and Visitation (T&V) extension approac
h, but with reduced levels of in-service 
training and fewer farmer visits
.  It is important to note that T&V Extension projects only 
strengthened the Department of Agriculture™s 
(DOA) extension system; extension programs in 
the other line departments, including Horticu
lture (DOH), Animal Husbandry (DAH), Fisheries 
(DOF), etc., were not improved.  Therefore, 
Tamil Nadu™s basic, multip
le agency extension 
structure remaining largely intact since the introduction of T&V Extension in the 1980s.  In short, 
each line department is still responsible for its
 own extension staff and programs, with little 
coordination at any level.  Also, since state government funding primarily goes for salaries and 
personal emoluments, most extension activities 
across all line departments are funded through 
ﬁtop-downﬂ central government schemes, plus ot
her subsidy and incentive programs that the 
extension field staff are expected to implement. 

 
4.19 New agricultural development priorities in Tamil Nadu are likely to bring about 
changes in the extension system
.  The GOTN has recognized the income generating and value-
added possibilities of the horticulture, sericulture, 
livestock and fisheries sectors.  In the Tenth 
Plan period there is an emphasis on horticultu
ral development, including agro-processing and 
marketing.  For example, the districts of Dhar
mapuri (Hussur), Nilgiri (Ooty) and Madurai have 
been earmarked for mango development, both fo
r processing and export.  The Agriculture and 
Processed Foods Export Development Authority (APEDA) is assisting the state in this venture.  
In addition, the GOTN plans to strengthen research
 and extension for the development of other horticultural crops, including fruit, 
vegetable and floriculture crops, plus cashews and medicinal 
plants.  This program is expected to focus on the organization and management of new supply 

chains, including domestic and export market de
velopment and investigating the feasibility of 
different types of value-added processing.  Since the GOTN has very limited extension capacity 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  46for horticulture development, it plans to li
nk agricultural, horticulture and agricultural 
engineering extension systems/units.

   48 4.20 Increasing public-private partnerships and pr
ivate sector involvement in extension 
is an encouraging development in the state.
  Public-private partnerships are also planned as 
industrial houses cooperate with extension by 
focusing on agricultural export and value-added 
processing opportunities.  For example, the New 
Anna Marumalarchi Thittam is focusing on 
small scale agro-industries.  Some industries bei
ng considered include edible oil extraction, paddy 
hulling, cashew processing, extraction of coconut oil, ice cream making, etc.  To date, no 
sustained expansion in the marketing of horticultural crops has taken place because extension has 
not been reorganized, strengthened and given a ne
w mandate for organizing farmer organizations 
that can systematically supply these planned new 
value chains.  If the ATMA model  (see Box 
4.1) could be introduced into Tamil Nadu, a more
 coordinated and systematic extension program 
could be organized at the district and bl
ock level to develop 
production and marketing 
arrangements for high-value commodities and to 
organized value-added processing enterprises.  
4.21 The state could also draw on a variety of 
international experiences with transforming 
extension systems into more client responsive ser
vices.  For example, Chile introduced a system 
of contracting private service providers in 1978, 
involving farmer organizations that propose 
defined projects for commercialization and mode
rnization of small-farm agriculture at a 
decentralized level.  In Keny
a, the Agricultural Technology and Information Response Initiative 
implemented by the Kenyan Agricultural Research
 Institute since 2000, provides grants averaging 
$3000 to farmers organizations or community-bas
ed organizations to finance acquisition of technologies, exchange visits to other farmers, and visits by institu
te staff.  Similarly, Bangladesh 
provided funding ($1,500 per year) to 
upazilas (sub-districts) to promote collaboration between 
public and private agencies through an average of
 four to five small-scale projects in each sub-
district (World Bank, 2004b).   
4.22 One innovative public-private sector initiative involves the disseminating of 
extension information to farmers through th
e use of internet kiosks in rural areas
.  The 
system allows farmers to obtain up-to-date 
information on major crop prices, advances in 
production technologies, as well as other information on various social services including schools 
and health facilities. Through these kiosks, called Pa
rry™s Corners, farmers can also send their 
queries regarding agricultural problems faced in th
e field to extension workers in the Department of Agriculture and researchers at the Tamil Nadu 
Agricultural University.  The kiosk attendant 
owns a digital camera that can be used to photogr
aph crop damage, pests inf
estations etc.  These photographs can then be transmitted to researcher
s and extension workers for diagnosis. This 
strategy has been successful in prompting ear
ly responses to several outbreaks of plant and 
animal diseases.

  49 Text Box  4.1:  The ATMA Approach to Extension 
 Several states in India have m
oved away from the T&V approach to
 a more decentralized extension 
approach that integrates extension programs across the major line departments, and introduces 
participatory, bottom-up planning procedures, resulting the creation of a more responsive, transparent 
and accountable extension system. In the mid-1990s the Government of India and the World Bank 

undertook a systematic assessment of the post-T&V Extension situation and then carried out a pilot 
project under the Innovations in Technology Dissemination (ITD) component of the National 
Agricultural Technology Project (NATP).  This proj
ect, which was launched in 1998, was designed to 
field-test a new extension model that focused 
on improving farm income through agricultural 
diversification.  The new model involved decentrali
zed, restructured and reoriented extension activities 
at the district and block levels through a new institution called the Agricultural Technology 
Management Agency, or ATMA.  (In Hindi, ATMA 
means ﬁsoul;ﬂ therefore, this new institution was 
to become the 
soul of agricultural development
 within each district.)  This ATMA approach has now 
been pilot tested in 28 project districts across 7 st
ates.  As a result of the successes achieved, in 2002 
the Government of India (GOI) adopted a new 
Policy Framework for Agricultural Extension
 that 
endorsed this new integrated approach. 

 
The new extension system promoted through the 
ATMA model places more 
emphasis on agricultural 
diversification and improving rural incomes.  The GOI™s new extension policy reflects the current 

agricultural development situation in India.  First, there is recognition that the country has achieved 

food security; therefore,
 extension priorities need to shift towards agricultural diversification and 
improving rural household income.  Second, this new 
policy recognizes that a) the private sector is 
assuming more responsibility for extension activities related to the major food and commercial crops; 
b) most productivity gains associated with high yielding varieties have already been exploited, 
therefore, further investments in DOA extension w
ill result in minimal returns on investment; and c) 
hunger in India today is essentially a poverty problem, therefore, further investments in field crop 
extension will do little to alleviate rural poverty and hunger. 
 
Given the successes achieved through the ATMA model, the GOI now recognizes that there is 
considerable scope to increase rural household income and reduce rural poverty by focusing on high 
value crop and livestock enterprises, including value-added processing.  This new policy agenda 

reflects a shift in focus from extension promoting field crop technology (i.e. supply driven), to a new 
focus on market driven opportunities for high value commodities.  In addition, many project districts 
have been successful in building ﬁsocial capitalﬂ by organizing and mobilizing rural women and 

unemployed young farmers to undertake these high value commodities and enterprises.  
 The combination of new goals, a decentralized approa
ch and a new integrated structure has created new 
enthusiasm for a public extension system that is more responsive to rural people and capable of 
increasing rural household income.  In addition, th
e ATMA framework provides mechanisms for cost 
recovery and strengthening research-extension linkages.  The combination of Block Technology Teams 
(BTTs), Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) and Farmer
 Associations (FAs) is also a more effective 
approach in disseminating information on specific high value commodities and/or enterprises. , making 

it possible to to reduce the long-term cost of extension by phasing out village extension workers 
through attrition. 
  505. Agricultural Markets and Market Policies  5.1 Development of agricultural markets will be 
essential for agricultural diversification 
and accelerated farmer income growth
.  Significant reforms in markets have taken place in 
recent years, giving a larger role to the priv
ate sector and removing movement restrictions. 
Promising institutional developments in marketing in
clude an expansion of contract farming, long 
established for sugar cane, which has begun on 
a small scale through private sector initiatives in 
cotton, gherkins (cucumbers), poultry and rice.   
5.2 As in most states of India, the public sector has historically played a major role in 
Tamil Nadu™s agricultural markets.  The initiatives of the government focused on framing rules 
and regulations to ensure fair trade practices, 
establishing institutional markets, building storage 
and warehousing facilities, creating institutions fo
r standardization and grading, and building 
awareness among farmers regarding the public ma
rketing infrastructure that was provided. 
5.3 Government intervention in markets 
involved three major channels: direct 
procurement and sales, regulated markets, and cooperatives.
  In Tamil Nadu, the government 
intervened directly in paddy, rice, sugar and cotton markets through 
direct procurement and 
sales.  It also placed restrictions on private trade, and set up 
regulated markets
 to facilitate 
transactions between farmers and licensed traders
, in order to provide fair prices for farmers 
and ensure fair trading practices.  Restricti
ons on movements of commodities were designed to 
prevent sales to importing regions from causi
ng shortages in exporting regions.  Licensing 
requirements helped the government monitor tr
aders and limit their scales of operation.  
Cooperatives were actively encouraged and had si
gnificant roles in milk markets.  
Private trade in unregulated markets
 operated only on a small scale, mainly at the village level, yet accounted 
for the large majority of sales of most crops other than paddy and sugar cane . 
5.4 Significant reforms have taken place in the 1990s in Tamil Nadu, increasing the role 
of the private sector in general.  
The scale of direct procurement of paddy has been reduced 
(and the GOTN no longer procures paddy on its
 own account), though regulated markets and 
cooperative sectors continue.  More recently, 
the GOTN has actively encouraged private 
marketing through lifting of stock and movement 
restrictions for rice, waiving of the cess on 
cotton sales, promotion of contract farming,
 and planned investments in rural market 
infrastructure.  Market Structure: Regulated and Private Markets 
 5.5 Tamil Nadu has 270 regulated markets
 and 15 sub-markets, located at major assembling 
centers, managed by 16 market committees at district level.
  At the top of the organizational 
structure is the state-level 
Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, 
an autonomous 
and advisory body that helps the market comm
ittees to organize and implement development 
activities, and plans for improvements in marketing of
 agricultural produce in the state. It is also 
responsible for development of infrastructural facilities at market committee level, enabling 
publicity and propaganda activities of the regulated
 markets,  and training the market committee 
personnel.  5.6 Market committees
 are headed by a chairman who is
 selected from among the members. 
The market committees collect ce
ss for the marketed agricultu
ral produce in their respective defined operational areas. Market cess for the sale 
of notified commodities, whether sold within 
the premises of regulated markets or outside, we
re increased from 0.45 per cent to one per cent 
during the last decade. Selling notified commodities 
within the premises of regulated market is 
Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  51purely voluntary. Tax assessments on sales outside
 of regulated markets are based on sales 
declarations of traders to tax collectors. Traders who pay the cess on their sales outside of 
regulated markets receive no direct benefit from the 
regulated markets.  For these traders, the cess 
functions as a general sales tax. 5.7 The regulated markets have been provided with infrastructural facilities like godowns, 
commercial grading centres and drying yards. We
lfare schemes to encourage farmers to bring 
their produce to regulated markets such as pl
edge loans and Tamil Nadu Farmers Development 
Welfare Scheme are also operated.  
5.8 Overall, regulated markets account for only about 10 percent of the total value of 
sales of all foodgrains. For the  major crops  with significan
t sales in regulated markets (paddy, 
maize, ragi, green and black gram, groundnuts,
 sesame, turmeric and cotton) these markets 
account for only 15 percent of the value of production.)
 (Table  5.1).
  There are large variations 
across region and by commodity, however, with re
gulated markets in Cuddalore, Villupuram and 
Thiruvannamalai districts (northeast zone) having high volumes of transactions and markets in 
Madurai, Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli districts (southern zone) with relatively few transactions.  Surveys by the Department of 
Agricultural Economics, Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University indicate that farmers are aware of th
e regulated market, but that small and marginal 
farmers with very small marketable surplus tend 
to sell their produce to village traders.   
5.9 Regulated markets account for a higher percentage of sales of turmeric (42 percent), 
sesame (55 percent).
  Market committees for turmeric in Erode and Trichy districts (western 
zone and Cauvery delta) have been particularly
 successful in spurring production, sales and 
exports.   5.9 Marketing through Primary Co-operative 
Marketing Societies (PCMS) account for 
an even smaller share of trade (Table 5.2).  
Through the PCMS at the local (taluk) level, the 
Tamil Nadu Co-operative Marketing Federation 
(TANFED) procures cotton, paddy, chilly, 
sunflower seeds, coriander, blackgram and other cr
ops.  It thus acts as an agent of the National 
Agricultural Marketing Federation of India (
NAFED) to provide price support and promote 
exports.  The PCMS also assists member farmers in processing, storing and marketing their 
agricultural produce, in some instances providing
 credit, arranging auction sales, or directly 
purchasing agricultural produce.  The total value of the produce marketed through the 
cooperatives has increased over time (Table  5.3) mainly due to marketing of cotton and 
sugarcane.   5.10 In 1999, the Tamil Nadu Government established Farmers Markets (
Uzhavar 
Sandhai) for fruits and vegetables to reduce marketing costs between growers and 
consumers.
  At present nearly 100 Farmers Markets are 
functioning in the state, in parallel with other marketing channels.   
5.10 Small village markets (shandies) provide
 markets for sales and purchases of 
agricultural commodities, as well as agricultural inputs consumer goods.  On an average, 
each shandy caters to a geographical area of a
bout 15 square kilometers. and a population of 
about 30,000 spread over about 25 villages.  The total volume of marketable surplus of 
agricultural commodities passing through the periodi
c markets in India is somewhere between six 
and twenty per cent of the surplus.

  Rice Markets 
 5.11 For three decades, from the early 1960s to
 the early 1990s, the state government 
controlled the majority of paddy trade, procur
ing paddy for the public distribution system.  
In the early 1960s, the state procured five bags 
of paddy (65 kgs each) per hectare, for all the 
farms having about one hectare under paddy. Later, 
this was restricted to the Cauvery Delta zone 
(zone IV) under the monopoly procurement scheme, 
by which the entire marketable surplus of 
paddy in the region was to be sold only to the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation.  
5.12 In 1993-94, a system of parallel procurement was introduced for paddy which 
continues to date.  
 Under the system of parallel procurem
ent, farmers have the option to sell 
their marketable surplus of paddy either to 
the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation at 
procurement prices or to private traders at market prices. Since October 2002, the state 
government has not procured rice on its own beha
lf, but instead the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies 
Corporation procures rice on behalf of the F
ood Corporation of India at the Minimum Support 
Price (MSP) fixed by the GoI.  Unlike in most other states of India, neither the Food Corporation 

of India nor the state government procures rice through a levy on rice mills.

Source: TNAU (2003).  Promoting Agricultural Development in Tamil Nadu 
 5.13 Substantial private sector rice trade takes place between Tamil Nadu and the 
neighboring states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala,
 with exports consistently 
mainly of coarse rice and imports consisting largely 
of finer rice varieties.  Movement restrictions 
preventing the export of Tamil Nadu to other stat
es, and storage restrictions for paddy/rice by 
millers and traders were also lifted during 1993-94.
38 No data on inter-state trade exists, but rough estimates of net trade can be made on the 
basis of changes in within state supply from 
production and net public distribution (incl
uding both ration sales and various employment 
programs), together with estimates of demand derived from an assumed base year demand, 

changes in real prices and incomes, and demand parameters (
Table  5.1). 
5.14 Demand estimates for various years in 
Table  5.1 use 2001/02 as a 
base, and assume that no net private trade took place in that year.  Per 
capita availability from production (less ten percent 
for seed, feed and losses) and net public distri
bution (total distribution less procurement of 
paddy/rice in Tamil Nadu) was 134.8 kgs/person in 2001/02, slightly below the average of 139.2 
kgs/person for 1997/98 to 2001/02.  Estimates of
 consumption in other years assume either 
constant per capita demand (estimate 1) or an 
own-price elasticity of demand for rice of Œ0.5 and 
an income elasticity of demand for rice of 1.0 (estimate 2).

 38 Note that prior to October 2002, monopoly procurement was reinstated in several years (e.g. in 1996-97 
when 922 thousand tons were procured, as well as in 1999-00 and 2000-01), in order to assure the GoTN of 
rice supplies. 39 Estimates of the income elasticity of demand for rice range from– AIDS model estimates by Kailasam 
(1991) for households in western Tamil Nadu ranged from 0.956 to 1.241 for rural household groups and 
0.695 to 1.121 for urban household groups.  Own-price elasticities ranged from Œ0.262 to -0.530 (rural) and 
-0.278 to -0.593 (urban).  Hazell and Ramasamy (1991)

Draft  (not for distribution or citation) 
  56 5.15 Estimates of demand and net trade indicate that, in years of normal rainfall and 
water availability, Tamil Nadu is nearly self-sufficient in rice.
  From 1997/98 to 2001/02, 
production of paddy within the state accounted 
for an estimated 89 to 95 percent of total 
consumption for the period as a whole.  During th
ese years, net public distribution averaged 1.19 
million tons, (about 15 percent of consumption), a
nd estimated average private trade net exports 
were about 300 Œ 800 thousand tons, (equal to 3 
to 10 percent of estimated consumption).   
5.16 In 2002-03 a drought year, private net rice inflows contributed an estimated 1.0-1.3 
million tons to total availability, eq
ual to 12-16 percent of consumption. 
Because of the severe drought in 2002-03, production 
of paddy fell by 2.47 million tons (a decline of 34 percent) 
compared to the average of the previous five 
years.  Net public distribution of rice was 2.15 
million tons, equal to the level of total distri
bution, since no procurement took place. Assuming 
constant per capita demand, net private trade fl
ows are estimated at 1.32 million tons, 16 percent 
of consumption.  Alternatively, adjusting for th
e higher price rise and an estimated 2.7 percent 
decline in per capita incomes relative to 2001/02, pe
r capita rice consumption fell by 2.7 percent 
and private imports were 
only about 1.0 million tons. 
5.17 Private trade flows helped stabilize market supplies and prices (
Figure  5.1).  
The influx of 1.0-1.3 million tons of rice imports from other states (and abroad) through the private 
market trade helped stabilize prices without a majo
r increase in public distribution in the state.  
Rice prices in Tamil Nadu closely traced those in A
ndhra Pradesh (a major source of private rice 
inflows to the state), reflecting the integration of 
these markets. As a result, the retail market price 
of rice in 2002/03 in Tamil Nadu was only 2.8 pe
rcent higher in real terms (nominal prices 
deflated using the GSDP deflator) than in 200
1/02 helping to maintain access to food for poor 
consumers.  5.18 The experience of 2002/03 suggests that private rice flows can play a major role in 
stabilizing rice prices and supplies in drought ye
ars, even apart from major increases in net 
public distribution.  Given these private rice flows, made po
ssible in part by the overall rice 
supply and demand balance in India as a whole, self-sufficiency in rice is not a prerequisite for 
food security in the state.  Nonetheless, availa
bility of low-cost rice through the PDS, coupled 
with employment schemes remains important for th
e welfare of poor households, particularly in 
drought years. 
Markets for Sugar Cane and Milk 
 5.19 Marketing of sugar cane to sugar mills 
involves contract farming arrangements between farmers and the state™s  sugar mills (2 public sector mills operated by the Tamil Nadu Sugar Corporation Limited, 16 cooperative sector mi
lls, and 19 private sector mills).  The total crushing capacity of these 38 mills is 104,550 to
ns crushing per day (TCD) and about 19.0 
million tons per year. During the crushing season 
2001-2002, the mills operated at full capacity, 
crushing 19.14 million tons of cane, and producing 
18.39 million tons of sugar, with an average 
recovery rate of 9.61 percent. 
5.20 The contract farming system for sugar cane 
provides a floor price for sugar farmers (who 
always get at least the SMP price) and divides the benefits of high market prices between farmers 
and mills.  These explicit sales contracts also help 
to insure mills of regular supply of sugar cane. 
Under the contracting system for sugar cane, farmers receive initial payments equal to the 
                                                                                                                               
                               set from 1972/73 and the early 1980s ranged from 0.32 to 0.39, with own price elasticites ranging from Œ
0.17 to -0.28.

  57statutory statutory minimum price (SMP) set by the GOI multiplied by the total quantity of sales 
to the mill.  (Note that the SMP is made known 
to the farmers well in advance of the sowing 
season for sugar cane.)  When average market 
sales prices of processed sugar rise above the 
government-determined approximate average cost of
 processed sugar (the ﬁ5A priceﬂ, which is 
determined from industry average rendements
40, average processing costs, and estimated capital 
depreciation costs), a second payment is made to
 farmers, in which the sales revenues arising 
from the positive margin between th
e actual sales price and the 5A price is split evenly between 
mill and farmer.  (In Tamil Nadu, an even higher pr
ice, the State Advised Price (SAP) is paid by 
state mills, but not by private mills.)   
5.21 In Tamil Nadu, as in most of India, milk is
 sold through Milk Producers Co-operatives at 
the village level.  Farmers supply milk to the 
society at a pre-determined price based on fat 
content and solid non fat.  The society also pr
ovides technical guidance and financial assistance. 
Commodity Marketing Boards 

5.22 Commodity boards for plantation crops, su
ch as the Tea Board and Coffee Board, were established by the 
Ministry of Commerce, Government of
 India. Each Board offers various schemes to i) develop new technologies and prom
ote adoption of the same, so as to increase 
productivity, ii) provide support for various marketing 
activities, iii) to initiate efforts to promote 
exports and iv) to maintain a data 
bank and undertake extension activities. 
5.23 The Tea Board promotes tea research and exports of tea worldwide, collects and 
disseminates statistical data as well as encourag
es labor welfare programs among a host of other 
activities all aimed at ensuring the health and vibr
ancy of the world™s largest producer of tea. 
Until 1995, the Coffee Board had a monopolistic cont
rol over the marketing of coffee in India. 
However, the winds of liberalization swept the 
Indian coffee industry and since 1995, marketing 
of coffee is strictly a private sector activity. 
Contract Farming 5.24 The pace of reforms has accelerated in recen
t years and the state is now supporting 
new initiatives in contract farming and agricultural exports (Text Box  5.1).  Contract farming 
involving business agreements for purchase of output and often provision of inputs and extension advice is increasing, particularly for sugar cane,
 cotton, and horticultural crops. For medicinal 
plants, contract farming has just begun wherein the wholesaler comes in agreement with the 
farmer producers. A contract made is for an ag
reed price under the technical guidance of the 
buyer and assistance is ensured to the farm
ers in getting financial support from nationalized 
banks.  5.25 Cotton contract farming has just started 
in about 1200 hectares in 2002-03 season 
and it is expanding. 
The only difference is that the farmers 
have the option to sell cotton to the 
contractor or to any other buyer under the market
 prices prevailing during harvest period. For the 
services provided by the contractor, a nominal charge
 will be levied on the farmer on an unit area basis. 5.26 Gherkin cultivation and processing started in India in the early' 90s and at present 
is spread over 7,900 hectares in the three southe
rn states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and 
Andhra Pradesh.
 Although gherkins can grow virtually in any part of the country, the ideal 
conditions required for growth 
prevail in these three states where the growing season extends 
through out the year. There are about twelve companies operating in the state and each company

5.27 Contract farming for poultry is also practiced
 in Tamil Nadu.  For broilers, firms supply 
chicks, feed, medicines and technical guidance to th
e farmers.  The firms then buy the birds when 
they are eight weeks old at a predetermined price.   
Rural Infrastructure 
 5.28 Tamil Nadu™s rural infrastructure is relative good compared to most other states in 
India, but further improvements will have high pay-offs.  
Almost 100 percent of  Hamlets  
(47, 838 out of a total of 47,853 Hamlets) in 
the state are electrified. Access to rural water supply 
is also fairly high.  Ninetly-four percent of rura
l habitations are fully covered in terms of access to 
rural water supply while the remaini
ng 6 percent are partially covered.
41Although Tamil Nadu 
has an extensive road network, further attention 
to maintenance and upgrading of rural roads in 
some regions may be warranted.

access to 40 lpcd. Partially covered habitations are ha
bitations with a water suppl
y of less than 40 lpcd.

  59Text Box  5.1:  Contract farming in Tamil Nadu: New Initiatives for Rice  
Contract farming involves a business agreement between a farmer and a firm in which the firm 
may provide inputs, extension services, processing and 
a ready market in return 
for a guaranteed source of 
supply of the output product.  Such arrangements 
between sugar mills and cane farmers has long been 
practiced in Tamil Nadu and other parts of India.  For other products, however, restrictions on private 
sector trade motivated by a general mi
strust of traders, along with the 
structural characteristics of output 
markets (including the inability to differentiate products by quality or brand) have greatly limited the 
scope of contract farming.    
 Contract farming offers several potential benefits: it 
can reduce market risk for both farmers and firms, 
facilitate technology adoption as firms with access to capital an
d knowledge of new production 
technologies have an incentive to assist farmers in improving quality and productivity, and enhance 
quality of the final product, increasing value addition in
 processing.  Potential adverse implications of 
contract farming exist as well, though, since there is a possibility that firms may acquire significant 

market power as they expand, to
 the detriment of farmers.   
 Contractual arrangements between sugar cane farmers and sugar mills have a long history in India.  

Economies of scale in sugar processing technology, ra
pid perishibility of the product (the yield of sugar 
extracted from the cane (ﬁrendementﬂ) declines sign
ificantly within days of harvesting the cane), and 
difficulties of transporting bulky sugar cane, make fi
xed contracts between local sugar mills and farmers 
desirable from an efficiency standpoint.  To pr
otect the interests of both farmers and mills, the 
Government of India 
placed marketing regulations on sugar cane
 and created a system of administered 
prices.     Beginning in a limited way in 2002/03, EID Parry to
ok tentative steps towards establishing contract 
farming in rice.  EID Parry sold approximately 60 tons of improved seeds for super fine quality ponno 

rice (enough for about 800 hectares of rice at a seed
 rate of 75 kgs/hectare)
 and provided extension 
services to sugar cane farmers who sold sugar cane to
 the firm™s sugar mill in 
Cuddalore, and were also 
wiling to grow rice.  With the improved rice technology, paddy yields were approximately 25 percent 

higher than normal yields of 3.75
 tons/hectare.  Moreover, because of
 drought, market prices were about 
20 percent higher than the previous year.   
 EID Parry later purchased the output.  In the absence of
 an explicit sales contract, though, the firm risked 
not being able to purchase supply for its rice mills. 
In 2003/04 the firm plans to make commitments to 
farmers to procure rice at market prices from farmer
s who purchase seed.  If the trial is successful, the 
firm may providing inputs on credit and establish explicit sales contracts that are binding for farmers in 
future years.  (EID Parry™s existing contracts with
 the same farmers for sugar cane may provide an 
implicit additional enforcement mechanism to deter farmer default.) 
 The entrance of large private firms 
into rice markets has only been possible with the removal of stocking 
limits (in May 2003), and other restrictions on move
ments of paddy and rice.  Availability of new seed 
and processing technology, combined with firms™ market knowledge could make contract farming 

arrangements profitable for bot
h farmers and firms.  If quality is impr
oved, and is noticeable so that rice 
achieves higher price, firms will be able to afford to 
pay higher prices, particularly if brand names can be 
established. Maintaining competition between trader
s will remain important, however, since if firms 
significantly increase their market sh
ares, monopoly power of the firms could reduce benefits for farmers.  
Institutional arrangements (such as promotion of farmer organizations) may also be needed to make sure 
small farmers benefit, as well.  
   606. Agricultural Growth and Rural Poverty  6.1 Rural poverty is concentrated amongst rural la
ndless laborers and small farmers (especially 
those without significant amounts of irrigated land)
.  The PDS is an important safety net for the 
rural poor.  Ration sales from public stocks, co
mbined with targeted public nutrition and 
employment programs, and price-stabilizing market flows of rice from neighboring states enabled 

the state to avoid serious declines in welfare of the poor during 2002-03, a year of severe drought.  

The extent to which future agricultural growth
 reduces rural poverty will depend on the degree to 
which small farmers shift to cultivation of highe
r value crops and have access to remunerative 
markets, and labor demand increases, par
ticularly in the dry seasons.      
Rural Poverty42 6.2 The latest available data indicate that th
ere were between 7 and 11 million rural poor among Tamil Nadu™s population of  62 million in 1999/00 (
Table  6.1:). 
Findings on the 
incidence of poverty in rural versus urban 
areas in Tamil Nadu vary depending on the 
methodology used to estimate poverty lines.
43 According to the official Planning Commission 
estimates, the incidence of poverty in rural areas w
as lower than that of urban areas. The adjusted 
estimates of Deaton and Drèze (2002) arrive at 
the opposite conclusion reporting an incidence of 
poverty in urban areas less than half of that in
 rural areas.  Estimates by Kijima and Lanjouw 
(2003) also find that urban poverty is below rural 
poverty.  According to Kijima and Lanjouw, the 
estimated poverty rate in 1999/00 was 31.8 percent in
 rural areas compared to a poverty rate of  
22 percent in urban areas. The same authors also
 find that Tamil Nadu was the most poor of the 
Southern states, and had a higher incidence of 
poverty than India as a whole. These findings 
differ from those of Deaton and Drèze (2002) that reveal a slightly lower incidence of poverty in 
Tamil Nadu as compared to India as a whole.

 6.3 Tamil Nadu™s rural poverty rates have declined over time.  
All three sets of poverty 
estimates report declining rural poverty rates althoug
h they differ in their estimates of the rate of 
decline. Kijima and Lanjouw™s (2003) estimates suggest a decline in rural poverty in Tamil Nadu 
between 1993/94 and 1999/00 of about 6.7 per
centage points compared to a decline of 14.2 
                                                     
 42 This section draws heavily on the Tamil Nadu Poverty Note:  Poverty in the 1990s, A Preliminary 
Profile and Emerging Issues by Peter Lanjouw, Rajshri Jayaraman and Yoko Kijima.  The Tamil Nadu 
poverty note provides an analysis of poverty issues in the state drawing on existing household survey data 
and village studies.  This section summarizes some of the main findings of the poverty note pertaining to 
the incidence and profile of rural poverty in the state. 
43 Refer to Lanjouw et al., 2003 for a detailed summary of the various methods and their findings. 
   61percentage points reported by Deaton and Drèze (2002).  The official Planning Commission 
estimates suggest a decline in the rura
l poverty rate of 12.3 percent.  
6.4 The limited data on rural poverty over ti
me suggests a correlation with labor and 
land productivity growth, though no definitive conclusions are possible
.  From 1987/88 to 
1999/00, rural poverty decreased from 45.6 to 20.6 
percent.  During this same period, land 
productivity grew by 3.9 percent per year and 
labor productivity increased by 3.3 percent per 
year.  Given the importance of returns to land fo
r small farm incomes a
nd labor earnings for all 
rural poor households, these gains in land and labor productivity certainly contributed to raising 
rural incomes.  However, since non-agricultura
l incomes also account for a large share of 
incomes of the poor, more data and analysis at th
e household level (ideally 
with panel data sets) would be required to quantify the effect of
 agricultural productivity gains on rural poverty.

   6.5 There are marked regional variations in the 
rural poverty with a higher incidence of 
rural poverty in the Coastal North and South
. The incidence of  rural poverty  (according to 
the Lanjouw and Kijima estimates) appears to
 be higher in the Coastal North and South.
44 Between 1993/4 and 1999/0, poverty fell in all N
SSO regions with the exception of the Coastal 
North, where the poverty incidence, based on th
e Kijima-Lanjouw adjustment methodology, is 
estimated to have risen from 21 percent to 29 percent. 
6.6 The rural poor in Tamil Nadu typically own 
less land than the non-poor and are highly represented among the marginal landowners.
   Rural poverty is concentrated among those with 
marginal landholdings, and is lowest among tho
se with relative large landholdings. The incidence 
of poverty appears to be lower among the landl
ess (non-agricultural households) as compared to 
marginal landholder (those with less than 0.4 
hectares of land). Access to land alone does not 
                                                     
 44 Coastal North districts include Chennai, Thiruvalluvar, Kancheepuram, Thiruvannamalai, Vellore, 
Villupuram, Cuddalore.  South districts include Tiru
chirapalli, Parambalur, Ariy
alur, Karur, Nagapattinam, 
Thiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai. Coastal districts include  Dindigul, Madurai, Theni, Virudhunagar, 
Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukkudi, Tirunelveli, Kanniyakumari.  Inland districts include 

Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Dharmapuri. These regional classifications are based on the 
National Sample Survey Organization™s regional zonal classifications. 
Source:  Authors™ Calculations.   
Note:  Poverty rates are based on the unadjus
ted official Planning Commission poverty lines 
which overestimate the decline in poverty rates due
 to non-comparability of
 the expenditure data 
between the 55th round and previous rounds of the NSS. 
   62allow rural households to escape poverty. Estimates from 1999/00 reveal that 20 percent of  
households owning more than 4 hectares of land
 were poor  (fell in the bottom two quintiles of 
per capita consumption) compared to an pove
rty incidence of 45 percent among marginal 
landholders.  6.7 In Tamil Nadu the risk of poverty is co
nsiderably more pronounced amongst those 
whose land is not irrigated. According to estimates from 1999/00, approximately 42.1 percent 
of households without irrigation were poor (per 
capita consumption rank of less than 40 percent) 
as compared to 33.8 percent of household with
 irrigation. Among marginal landholders 45.4 
percent of households without access to irrigation were poor compared to a poverty incidence of 
39.3 percent among marginal landholders
 with access to irrigation.   
6.8 The rural poor are more likely to be reliant on agriculture as a source of income.  
Farming contributes to over 50 percent of rura
l income. The poorest households (those in the lowest income quintile) receive almost 78 pe
rcent of these income from cultivation and 
agricultural wage labor.  In fact, almost 52 per
cent of the income of the poorest households can 
be attributed to agricultural wage labor alone. 
As one moves from the lowest to highest income 
quintiles,  the contribution of agricultural wage 
income to total income decreases monotonically, 
while that of cultivation and non-farm sources in
creases monotically.  Wealthier rural households 
appear to have access to more assets (physical a
nd human capital) allowing them to participate in 
more remunerative non-farm employment activities. 
6.9 About one-fifth of the population in Tamil Na
du belongs to scheduled castes or tribes 
whose average standard of living is cons
iderably below the rest of the population.
  Eighty-
eight percent of SC/ST households owned less 
than 0.4 hectares of land in 1999/00. SC/ST 
households have a lower mean per capita consum
ption as well as lower levels of education as 
compared to non-SC/ST households. Scheduled cast
e and scheduled tribe population groups are 
highly represented in agricultural wage labor ac
tivities and  are particularly under-represented 
among cultivators and in regular non-farm employment.

  6.10 In both urban and rural areas, average consum
ption levels of households where the head 
had completed secondary education or higher are 
about twice as high as when the household head 
was illiterate. 
Labor Markets 6.11 Real wage rates in agriculture have risen steadily in the 1990s.
  The average annual increase in the real wage for male labor for harvesting increased from 2.8 percent per year during 
1986-92 to 7.2 percent per year during 1993-2001 (
Table  6.3).  During this latter period (1993-
2001), paddy and rice prices declined by an average 
of 2.0 percent per year in real terms due to 
increased productivity (yields) of paddy in Tamil Na
du, and in recent years, the declining cost of 
   63imported rice in neighboring states
.  Thus, the real wage in terms of paddy (rice) grew by an 
average of 9.8 percent per year from 1992/93 to 2000/01, again indicating increased purchasing 
power for rural laborers (
Figure  6.2).

   6.12 A declining rural labor force reflecting sign

major factor behind the rise in real agricultural wages.  
According to the Population Census, 
total population in the state increased by 6.25 million people (11.2 percent)  between 1991 and 
2001.  In this period, urban 
population grew by 8.16 million people (42.8 percent); rural 
population actually declined by 1.91 million (5.2
 percent).  The rural population was thus 12.8 
percent less than it would have been if both the 
rural and urban populations
 increased by the same 
state-wide rate (11.2 percent).   6.13 For farmers that hire labor, however,
 increased labor costs imply reduced 
profitability.  Increases in labor costs have been partia
lly offset by increases in yields, thus 
limiting the decline in farmer paddy incomes.  More
over, higher costs of labor have encouraged 
mechanization, including the use of power tillers 
for land preparation and mechanical harvesters for paddy.  Nonetheless, higher labor costs are adversely affecting incomes of commercial 
farmers in Tamil Nadu, particularly in areas 
where urban and rural non-farm employment are 
   64increasing, such as the western zone (with its textile and other industries around Coimbatore) and 
in the northeast near Chennai.   Technological Change and  Rural Poverty 
 6.14 Despite concerns that the green revolution technology for rice (improved seeds, 
increased fertilizer use and irrigation) would 
lead to increased income inequality, most 
rural household groups benefited from increa
sed rice production in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Household surveys of farmers in North Ar
cot district (now Vellore and Thiruvannamalai 
[check]) indicated that, although the first adopters of the rice technology tended to be larger 
farmers, by the early 1980s small farmers in v
illages with access to irrigation had also adopted the new technologies at the same rate as large 
farmers (Hazell and Ramasamy, 1991).  Moreover, 
land distribution had remained essentially unch
anged, and agricultural wage earnings for 
agricultural laborers increased (though real 
agricultural wage rates did not increase). 
 6.15 Moreover, increased rice production led 
to substantial rural growth linkages, adding 
an additional 0.87 rupees of value added for ev
ery 1 rupee of value added from additional rice 
production.  One-half of these multiplier effects 
were due to increased demand for agricultural 
inputs, marketing and processing services; the 
remainder derived from increased consumer 
demands as household incomes rose. 

6.16 Survey results showed that real incomes of small paddy farmers and landless laborers 
rose by 90 and 125 percent, respectively, between 1973/74 to 1983/84.  Incomes of non-
agricultural households also rose by 55 percent, 
due in part to the growth linkage effects 
emanating from agricultural growth.  Real inco
me gains of large paddy farmers were only 18 
percent, due to increased costs of fertilizer and labor.  Notably, non-paddy with no access to 

irrigated land saw real income gains of only 17 percent. 
6.17 On an all-India scale, agricultural productivity growth from 1958-1994 played a 
major role in reducing poverty in India. 45  During this period, agricultural output per acre of 
net sown area grew by 2.91 percent per year, c
ontributing to higher real wages for agricultural 
laborers (which grew by 2.84 percent per year) and a decline in the real price of food.  (The price 
of food relative to agricultural laborers™ consumer price index fell by 0.15 percent per year from 
1976-94, after having increased by 0.62 percent per year from 1958-75.)  Higher farm yields for 
small producers also contributed directly to thei
r incomes, both directly through increased value 
of output and indirectly through increased employment.     
6.18 Whether future agricultural growth reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu reduces rural 
poverty will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new technologies and have 
access to markets, the magnitude of employmen
t and real wage rate gains, and the size of 
linkage effects with rural non-agriculture
.  Further reductions in the real price of food are not 
likely given the already low food prices (particularly in Tamil Nadu where the poor have access 
to subsidized rice through the PDS).  Land distribu
tion is unlikely to become more egalitarian and 
thus contribute to a redistribution of incomes, a
nd could even become more concentrated instead.   
6.19 Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor.
  Increased availability of water and great
er efficiency of water use in the dry 
                                                     
 45   Datt and Ravallion, 1998, Farm productivity and rural poverty in India, Journal of Development 
Studies, No. 34, April 
   65season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops will 
be crucial, however.  Contract farming ma
y help overcome these problems, if competition 
between firms helps farmers maintain their shar
e of the value of the final product sales.   
6.20 The reduction in poverty is also likely to 
be greater if small farmers are able to 
participate in production and sales gains from off-season crops.
  New technologies like drip 
irrigation require substantial investments, and 
large farmers to adopt these technologies and shift 
to cultivation of higher value crops more quickly 
than small farmers.  Government programs to 
provide credit to small farmers were instrument
al in increasing adoption rates of rice technology in the 1970s and 1980s; the feasibility of similar 
targeted credit programs should be explored.   
      667. Conclusions and Policy Options 
 7.1 Traditional sources of agricultural growth
 in Tamil Nadu face major constraints
.  Seasonal water shortages, increasing land degradatio
n, continually shrinking farm sizes and rising 
costs of agricultural labor represent serious constrai
nts that need to be overcome if future growth 
in agriculture is to be realized. Further gains in rice production (a major engine of agricultural 
growth in the past four decades) will be hard to
 achieve, and may not be the most efficient use of 
resources in the context of national grain surpluses and the significant water requirements of rice 

cultivation.   7.2 Given the existing constraints, diversification into less water-intensive higher-value 
products, including fruits, vegetables, spices, and livestock products, is one of the most 
promising avenues for increasing agricultural growth. Tamil Nadu™s agro-climatic conditions 
are well suited to diversified agriculture. Furthe
rmore, rapidly increasing incomes and changing 
food demand patterns provide strong impetus fo
r diversification. Increased agricultural 
diversification and private investments in processing for many of the higher valued agricultural 
commodities are likely to generate new rural no
n-farm employment opportunities and contribute 
to higher rural incomes.
   7.3 Overcoming the constraints faced by the 
agricultural sector in Tamil Nadu, and 
accelerating growth in agricultural production 
and the rate of rural poverty reduction, will 
require appropriate policies and inv
estments in four priority areas
: improving the efficiency 
of water use; increasing the effectiveness of public expenditures and agricultural extension; 
spurring the development of agricultural markets; 
and maximizing the real income growth of the 
rural poor. Increasing the Efficiency of Water Use 
7.4 Long-term growth in agriculture and rural incomes depends in large part on 
increasing the efficiency of use of water
.  7.5 Tamil Nadu has already taken some important
 steps in expenditure and organization 
reforms in irrigation and drainage institutions th
at are vital to improving the delivery of surface 
irrigation services and helping to ensure the longer-term performance of irrigation infrastructure.   
Further organizational reforms to streamline 
business processes to enhance efficiency and 
transparency and professionalize the work culture
 will be essential to improving service delivery 
to the client farmers, reduce costs of servi
ce provision (especially by modernizing and 
rightsizing), ensure financial sustainability of op
erations and maintenance of systems, and reduce 
the fiscal burden to state governments. 
7.6 More specifically, there are several options that Tamil Nadu could consider to manage its 
scarce water resources. These include: 
scaling up the pilot river-basin framework
 for managing water resources holistically, 
allowing interagency coordination and public-private 
partnerships; introducing specific legally enforceable 
water entitlements
 to various users in a river basin and or aquifer framework; 
changes in electricity, water and crop prices
 to change 
the financial incentives for irrigation and crop choice; 
improved management practices and 
irrigation technologies (such as drip and sprinkler irrigation) and 
new investments in canals and 
water storage (coupled with impr
oved operation and maintenance).
 7.7 Public administration in the water sector could be improved by separating the 
responsibilities for water resource management and irrigation service delivery
.  Tamil Nadu 
is the only state in India without a separate department of irrigation: administration of irrigation 
in the state is part of the Department of 
Public Works.  Two new agencies are needed: a 
   67regulatory agency to allocate the share of wate
r resources to agriculture, industry and other uses, 
and a irrigation department focusing on irrigation delivery systems.  A separate irrigation 
department would allow for the creation of a specia
lized cadre of irrigation specialists, instead of 
the current setup where staff from the Departme
nt of Public Works (which also includes administration of public buildings) are res
ponsible for delivering irrigation services.   
7.8 Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) is at an early stage in Tamil Nadu and 
WUAs are yet to be fully functional.  
There is a need to expedite the transfer of irrigation 
management to farmers in line with the FMIS 
Act so that water distribution would be more 
efficient and equitable.   7.9 The Government of Tamil Nadu recently a
nnounced increases in irrigation water 
charges and reintroduced a tariff for agricultural power consumers
. While these recent 
reforms are a step in the right direction, chargi
ng for water on a per area basis (as is the case for 
surface irrigation) or on a flat rate basis (for agricultural power consumers) is not efficient from 
an economic point of view as the marginal cost for water is almost zero and hence it does not 
affect the demand for irrigation water. 7.10  Irrigation water charges were revised  in July 2003
.  Previously, water charges were 
levied by the GoTN at a base rate (which va
ried according to crop, season, soil quality etc) 
coupled with an additional cess equivalent to six times the base rate.  This additional cess was transferred to the local panchayats.  Under the ne
w system of charges an additional water charge 
of Rs 150/ha de-linked from any additional cess ha
s been imposed.  Thus the farmer will pay the 
original charge plus the Rs 150/ha.  In add
ition, the FMIS Act empowers the water user™s 
associations (WUA) to charge users between  Rs 
250/ha to Rs 500/ha.  This additional charge can 
be retained by the WUA for operation and maintena
nce of the systems turned over to them. The 
current provisions for irrigation water charges woul
d be sufficient to allow full cost recovery of 
required O&M expenditures. The extent to which fa
rmers are actually being charged the proposed 
water rates remains unclear.  
 7.11 In 2002 an agricultural power tariff was introduced bringing an end to 12 years of 
free electricity for Tamil Nadu™s farmers.  
The revised agricultural power tariff included a flat rate for unmetered connections of Rs.250 per HP per annum and Rs.0.20/kWh for metered 
connections.  In conjunction with the reintr
oduction of the agricultural power tariff the 
government announced a pilot income support scheme 
for small and marginal farmers.  However, 
the reintroduction of the agriculture power tariff b
ecame a highly contentious issue in Tamil Nadu 
during the recent national election, and after a significant loss of seats in the national parliament, 
the TN government has reversed the policy.
 7.12 Other states also introduced tariffs in recent years (
Text Box  7.1).  International 
experience with income support programs also pr
ovides several important lessons for providing 
clear incentives and containing fiscal costs, including the need for targe
ting to poorer farmers 
(e.g., paying less per hectare as farm size increases, with a ceiling on the numbers of hectares 
eligible for payment), an effective delivery sy
stem for the transfer payments, and a limit on the 
number of years for which producers will be eligible for payments (
Table  7.1).

  7.13 Introduction of a flat rate charges of Rs 250/year for a 5 horsepower pumpset (a 
policy that has now been reversed) would have only
 a small effect on net returns to land and 
management, reducing them by only 4.9 to 
6.5 percent for major crops grown with well 
irrigation.  Costs of crop cultivation using well irrigation would rise by only 625 Rs/ha for most 
crops (the annual charge pro-rated for one season) to 1250 Rs/ha (for sugar cane grown over 
eleven months). 
However, if electricity charges are 
raised to the estimated marginal 
economic price of electricity to agriculture of 
3.1 Rs/Kwh, electricity costs rise to about 
4,600 Rs/ha for paddy and sugar
 cane, reducing returns to land and management by 35.9 
percent for rice and 23.8 percent for sugar cane
.  Likewise, total returns to land, labor and 
capital (value added) fall sharply for paddy and s
ugar cane irrigated by wells when the cost of 
electricity for pumping is included.  If electricity is costed at its economic price, total income 
generated from cotton cultivation 
(23,949 Rs/ha) is 53 percent greater than that for rice.  
Including the subsidy on fertilizer (through the Go
I), raises the total subsidy on rice and sugar 
cane cultivated with well irrigation to 41.1 and 40.3  
percent of net financial returns at the flat rate 
cost of electricity. 
7.14 Such large policy-induced reductions in returns for farmers are likely to be 
politically infeasible (as indicated by the re
cent election results), but gradual step towards 
marginal cost pricing of electricity, (perhaps 
combined with compensa
tion to farmers in the 
form of income transfers or a more reliable electricity supply), would help rationalize water 
use in Tamil Nadu
.  If their costs and incomes varied according to the amount of electricity (and 
water) used with well irrigation, farmers would 
have an incentive to shift some land from water-
intensive crops (rice and sugar cane) towards less
 water-intensive crops (including cotton, maize 
and vegetables). Greater attenti
on to marketing infrastructure, strengthening the research and 
extension to meet the needs of diversified agriculture, the development of tools for farmers to 
better manage risks, and improving irrigation pum
pset efficiency may create an environment 
within which higher power charges woul
d be more palatable for farmers. 
Andhra Pradesh. In 2003, Andhra Pradesh initiated a ﬁtatkalﬂ
 scheme under which farmers seeking immediate 
connection are required to pay Rs. 1/kWh to expedite the connection of the utilities.  
The current rate for farmers is Rs. 0.25
/kWh 
(full cost is Rs. 4/kWh).  Under this scheme, 30,000 new conn
ections were provided during th
e year by the utilities.  The 
government and the utilities are also separating the supply of pow
er to farmers from the other 
consumers, by splitting the 11kV
 rural 
feeders.  This initiative has several me
rits, including the potential to monitor the reliability and quality of power supply to
 farmers 
and an increase in cost recovery. However, investment 
cost is high at  Rs. 10 million for each 11kV feeder.   
Karnataka.
 The State Electricity Board in Karnataka recently
 initiated a program called ﬁOwn Your Transformer 
Scheme for Irrigation Pumpsets,ﬂ involving 
the drawing of 11 kV HT line under High Volta
ge Distribution System to the premise o
f pumpset consumers and providing them with small capacity transfor
mers.  The government is asking farmers to share equally the 
cost of the investment with the utilities, which is estimated 
at about Rs. 50 billion.  The scheme has the potential to reduce 
losses 
and improve the quality of supply. But the cost of the program 
is substantial. Given the cost sharing arrangement, it is likely
 that the 
scheme would benefit mostly large farmers.   As a means to 
target the subsidies, the Karnat
aka regulatory commission for the 
purpose of determining different tariffs has classified farmers acco
rding to the number of tubewells
 they own, and to the fact 
that 
they do not perceive income from ot
her activities such as
 civil servants. User associations. The Electricity Act, 2003, provides for the Uni
on Government to issue a National Policy permitting 
stand alone systems (including those based 
on renewable sources of energy and non-conventional sources of energy) for rural are
as, 
and a National Policy for rural electrification and for bulk purchas
e of power and management of local distribution in rural ar
eas through Panchayat Institutions, users™ associ
ations, co-operatives societies, non-Governmental organizations or franchisees.  T
hese institutional models have been piloted in I
ndia.  In terms of internal efficiency, 
some cooperatives are working well while oth
ers are 
not.  In cases where it did not work well, 
one major cause was the lack of penalties in
 defaulting in payments to the public el
ectric 
utility.  The institutional model potentially promising, provided 
there is the willingness to proceed with disconnections in ca
se of 
non-payments.

   707.15 Increases in electricity charges would h
ave only small effects on overall rice 
production and market prices, but major impl
ications for sugar cane production in the 
state.  Since only about 10 percent of rice area cultiv
ated is irrigated with well water (about 200 thousand hectares), changes in electricity pricing 
would have only marginal effects on total rice 
production in the state.  Moreover, since net pub
lic distribution (averaging 1.2 million tons per 
year from 1997/98-2001/02, 18 percent of net production) and private market trade from 
neighboring states (estimated at 1.0 Œ 1.3 million tons in the drought year 2002/03) are major 

sources of supply of rice, the effect of lower 
rice production from well water-irrigated areas on 
market prices of rice would likely be small.
 Impacts on sugar cane production would be much 
more significant, however, as essentially all of ar
ea is irrigated in part with well water.  
 7.16 Greater attention is also need for scaling-
up the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies and modernizing irrigation infrastructure
. While the use of sprinkler and drip 
technology has been promoted in the state, th
e high capital cost of these technologies currently 
poses a constraint to widespread adoption by marg
inal and small farmers and greater attention to 
development of more affordable technologies is 
warranted or a suitable system of targeted 
subsidies should be developed to scale-up the use of sprinkler and drip systems. 
7.17 Improving the productivity of rainfed agriculture will require new investments and 
increased emphasis on
 community participation with sound technical inputs
 to improve the 
success of watershed programs.
 A basin perspective should be adopted in implementation of 
all watershed programs
 to ensure that these initiatives do not have negative impacts on 
downstream human and ecological uses
. Increasing the Effectiveness of Public Ex
penditures and Agricultural Extension  7.18 A highly effective research and agricultural ex
tension system is needed to respond to 
the needs of diversified agriculture.  An assessment of the state™s comparative advantage in 
producing higher value crops for the domestic a
nd export markets would also help in setting 
future research and development priorities.  Re
-orienting agricultural research to make it more 
farmer-responsive would likewise improve the outpu
t of a system that has enjoyed much success 
in rice technology development in the past. Simila
rly, the current extension system in the state 
remains organized around a modified Training and Visit approach and continues to be highly 
focused on major food-grains, though the promotion of
 public-private partnerships in extension is 
a very encouraging recent  development and offe
rs potential for both cost-savings and greater 
efficiency (
Figure  7.1).  Thus, it is recommended that the GoTN develop a new agricultural 
extension strategy to meet the changing needs 
of farmers. This could include adopting an 
integrated and decentralized extension system th
at could help build farmer organizations that 
could link with private firms to increase economic growth in rural areas.   
7.19 Rationalizing public expenditures and shi
fting expenditures from subsidies to 
investments in key public goods such rural 
roads, markets and agricultural research and 
extension will facilitate productivity improve
ments and diversification of agriculture to higher value products
. Tightening competition for limited fiscal resources heightens the urgency 
of appropriate public expenditure reallocati
on. Institutional reforms within government 
departments to ensure improved quality of deliver
y of rural-related public goods and services is 
also important.

   Promoting the Development of Well Functioning Agricultural Markets  7.20 Well functioning agricultural markets are al
so important for successful agricultural 
diversification. If recent policy reforms removing restrictions on purchase, movement, stocking 
and sales of paddy and 13 other crops are consisten
tly implemented at the local level, they can be 
expected to improve marketing efficiency
, reducing the margin between producer and 
consumer/export prices. Reductions in marketing 
costs are also necessary in order for production 
increases to lead to higher agricu
ltural incomes, particularly for perishable high-value products 
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, animal products). Contr
act farming and other private sector initiatives 
should be encouraged, though the impact of
 these business arrangements on farmer incomes 
should be evaluated, as well (
Text Box  7.2).  
7.21 There remain, however, important roles for the public sector in promoting agro-
food system and agro-enterprise development (
Text Box  7.3
).  In addition to policies that 
establish ﬁrules of the gameﬂ and address market fa
ilures, public investments in rural roads to 
strengthen rural connectivity can contribute to re
duced costs of marketing.  Although Tamil Nadu 
has an extensive road network, further attention 
to maintenance and upgrading of rural roads in 
some regions may be warranted.  
Given the rapidly changing nature of markets in Tamil Nadu, an 
in-depth study of market structure and 
investment needs would be useful.   
7.22 Increasing agricultural diversification will not compromise Tamil Nadu™s food 
security objectives given an effective PDS, we
ll-functioning markets and targeted nutrition programs
.  Greater food security has largely been 
achieved through increases in state production of major staples (especially rice), sales of subsidized rice through the PDS, school feeding 
programs, and targeted relief programs during droughts. During the recent drought of  2002/03 
the wholesale prices of rice only rose 2.8 percent (in real terms) above the previous year™s price, 

despite a 34 percent fall in paddy production in th
e state, helping to maintain access to food for 
poor consumers. This was largely due to privat
e sector inflows from neighboring states of Andhra 
Pradesh and Karnataka and the ava
ilability of rice through the PDS.

   72 Text Box  7.2:  Contract Farming in Punjab 
 Maximizing Real Income Growth for the Poor 
 7.23 Increasing employment and earnings in th
e dry season is especially important for 
the rural poor
.  Increased availability of water and great
er efficiency of water use in the dry 
season (for example, through the widespread adoption 
of drip irrigation) could enable cultivation 
of crops year-round, providing employment in
 agricultural production and processing.  
Dissemination of new production technology and establishing markets for dry season crops 
remains an important unresolved issue, however.  Contract farming may help overcome these 
problems, if competition between firms helps farmers 
maintain their share of the value of the final 
product sales.  The experience of Latin America 
and the Caribbean suggests that education, 
transport infrastructure, and engines of non-farm
 growth that promote female employment are 
key aspects of a success strategy
 to promote non-farm growth 
and rural poverty reduction (Box 
7.4). 7.24 Whether agricultural diversification reduces poverty in Tamil Nadu will depend on the extent to which small farmers adopt new 
technologies and have access to markets, the 
magnitude of employment and real wage rate gains, and the size of linkage effects with 
rural non-agriculture. An assessment of the implications
 for rural poverty reduction of an 
agricultural diversification strategy involving cap
ital-intensive technologies (e.g. drip irrigation) 
and higher-risk crops is needed. . This assessment
 should include a review of crop and  drought 
insurance instruments and the potential for innova

 Contract farming
 is production and marketing arrange
ment between farmers and processi
ng and/or marketing firms for the 
production and supply of agricultural products under forward agreemen
ts, frequently at pre-determined prices.  In Punjab, the 
state government has assigned the task of pr
omoting contract farming in the state to 
the Punjab Agro Foodgrains Corporation 
(PAFC), for which it has developed a five-year plan that aims 
to shift one million hectares out
 of rice-wheat cultivation to a 
variety of other crops.  PAFC sees its approach to be that 
of a facilitator, tying up farmers with agribusinesses which will 
supply quality seeds and technical assistance,
 and buy back the crop.  Various models
 are being tried out, but it is still too 
early to judge their effectiveness.   
 
Punjab agriculture appears to be well-suite
d for contract farming in terms of its 
physical and social environment Œ highly 
productive agriculture with assured irrigation, widespread
 mechanization, all villages connected by roads, good 
telecommunications, and average farm size more than twice the 
India average.  Moreover, PAFC™s venture into this field 
embodies a more market-oriented approach 
to agricultural development and a significan
t shift away from the state™s traditional 
focus on production as an end in itself.   

 
International experience suggests that cont
ract farming tends to succeed only in cer
tain types of crops/activities such as 
perishable products, or those where exacting market specifications 
have to be met.  Basic field crops like standard rice, wheat
, maize, oilseeds, pulses do not normally figur
e highly in contract farmi
ng programs and there is also a high risk of ‚side selli
ng™ i.e., farmer will sell output to another buyer.    
 The absence of a quick and effective contract enforcement and 
dispute resolution system in Punjab (and India) magnifies the 
risk of farmers ‚side selling™ if market prices at time of ha
rvest significantly exceed the contr
acted price, or conversely the
 risk 
of buyer default if market prices are we
ll below the contract price.  To address 
this, the state government needs to facilitate
 initiatives by agribusiness and fa
rmers organizations wishing to 
develop speedy dispute-resolution systems.  This might lead to
 a system for registration of contracts.  
The government™s role should generally be li
mited to that of a facilitator, however, s
ince 
to be successful, dispute-resolutions syst
ems are best designed by the interested 
parties.  Likewise, direct commercial 
involvement of the state should be minimal.  In some of the 
models being adopted this is not the case as PAFC is exposing 
itself to a high degree of risk by contracting to 
buy output from farmers in case the buyer backs out.

 The experience of Latin America and the Ca
ribbean in promoting the growth of the rural non-farm economy suggests some basic 
policy principles:   Agricultural policies can promote non-farm activities 
such as agro-processing and the other industrial, 
commercial and service sectors that characterize modern
 agriculture.  Agricultural 
policies in areas such as 
technology generation and diffus
ion, infrastructure, education, agrarian 
reform, credit, etc., should therefore be 
designed and developed with
 these links in mind. 
 Projects and policies aimed at promoting the rural non-
farm economy should not just focus on improving the 
capacity of households to become involved in the non farm
 economy, but should also st
imulate the engines that 
pull rural households into it.  Touris
m and manufacturing are examples of su
ch engines that are not traditionally viewed as part of the rural landscape.  Engines of
 non-farm growth that offer employment to women in 
particular, should be emphasized. 
 Local governments and institutional participation will need
 to be engaged in a whole variety of capacities, 
ranging from land use planning, educ
ation provision, infrastructure inve
stment, regulations, training, and 
financing. 
 Efforts must be directed to ensu
ring public institutions with responsibilities relating to non-farm activities 
(education, public works, small-scale industry, etc.) c
oordinate efforts and long beyond traditional competencies 
to include the non-farm economy.  Education and transport 
infrastructure in particul
ar, must receive concerted 
attention.  Richer and poorer zones must be treated differently, wi
th less emphasis in richer 
zones on subsidization and more on reducing transactions costs.  In poorer zones,
 public interventions to provide the basic enabling 
environment will continue to be required.
