March,, 2012655IntroductionAgriculture is an important sector in Tamil Nadu stateeconomy. It contributed 13 per cent to the state income.Nearly 56 per cent of population in the state is depending
on agriculture. It has the net cropped area of 5.12 million
hectares and nearly 56 per cent of the area is irrigated by
various irrigation sources. It has seven agro climatic zones
which are suitable for various crops. Tamil Nadu standsfirst in productivity of sugarcane and third in groundnut in
the country.Crop diversification is helpful for sustainability ofagriculture. Mono cropping affects soil health and creates
biotic and abiotic stress to the soil. Introduction of green
revolution in late 60™s and early 70™s to meet the foodshortage in the country had adversely affected the cropping
pattern in the country. Introduction of fertiliser responsiveand high yielding varieties in rice and wheat had converted
many states as a mono crop state. After attaining selfsufficiency in foodgrain production central and StateGovernment introduced many schemes to diversifycropping pattern to maintain food security. The cropcomposition further changed by the changes in prices,
rainfall and labour availability. In this context, it is necessaryto study the status crop diversification after forty years of
green revolution. Hence, the objective of the study is to
measure the crop diversification over the years in the
State.Methodology

Result and Discussion
Changes in share important cropsThe changes in share of important crops in grosscropped area are presented in Table 1. Paddy has thehighest share of nearly 32 per cent in gross cropped area
followed by groundnut, sorghum and fruits and vegetable.
Share of the major cereals has decreased over the years
except maize in the state. The share of paddy has decreased
from 32.5 per cent in 1980's to 31.5 in 2000-07. However, theshare of maize has increased from 0.34 per cent in 1980™s to2.68 per cent in 2000™s. The main reason could be theincrease in demand of maize for animal feed in the state.
Among the pulses, area under all crops has decreased
except black gram and green gram. Share of black gram has
increased from 2.64 per cent in 1980™s to 4.13 per cent in2000-07. Similarly, share of green gram has also increasedfrom 1.21 per cent in 1980's to 2.31 per cent in 2000-07.
Share of other major pulses like horse gram and Bengal
gram has decreased nearly 50 per cent over the years. Share
of chillies and onion has slightly improved over the years.
Share of sugarcane has increased from 2.88 per cent to 5.13
per cent. The main reason could be the increase in the
number of sugar mills and procurement price of sugarcane
over the years. Share of fruits and vegetable has doubled
in the study period. However, share of groundnut, gingellyand caster has decrease in the same period. In contrast,
share of coconut has tripled in the study period. Share of
cotton has decreased from 3.42 per cent in 1980-89 to 2.03
per cent in 2000-07.It is clear from the above discussion that the share ofmajor crops like paddy, groundnut and jowar has decreasedover the years in the state. However, share of minor cropslike maize, black gram, green gram, coconut and fruits and
vegetable has increased over the years in the state. This
shows that state is moving towards crop diversification
rather than specialisation.
Area Growth of Important CropsCompound growth rate of important crops ispresented in Table 2. It is observed from the table thatannual area growth rate of all cereals except maize has
grown negatively in the state. Maize has grown 5.88,
10.35 and 17.81 per cent in 1980™s, 1990™s and 2000™srespectively. Growth rate of maize is 10.71 per cent overthe study period. Area under bajra, ragi and jowar hasgrown negatively in the study period. Among the pulses,Black gram and green gram have grown positively and
the growth rate is constantly increasing over thedecades. Growth of area under Bengal gram has turnedpositive in the recent years. Growth rate of sugarcane
has increased 1.92 per cent in 80's to 3.25 per cent in
2000-07. Similarly, Area under fruits and vegetable hasgrown 2.4 percent, 3.87 per cent and 3.02 percent in 80™s,90™s and 2000-07 respectively. In contrast, Area undergingelly has reduced 5.54 per cent in 2000-07. Similarly,Area under groundnut has decreased nearly 3 per cent
in recent years. Area under coconut has increasedpositively over the years and it has grown 4.91 per cent
over the years. But, the area under cotton has decreased
in past two decades and area has reduced 5.58 percent
in recent years.Based on the area growth rates of crops in the state,it is evident that the crops are having the major shares like
paddy, groundnut and jowar have grown negatively in thestate. The crops are having the least share like maize,
sugarcane, coconut and green gram have grown positively
over the years. This gives further clear picture of crop
diversification in the State.Crop diversification in Tamil NaduResults of Crop diversification is presented in Table3. The index value was 0.17 in 1960-69 and it was reduced
to 0.13 in 2000-07. It is clear from the results that the crop
diversification is taking place over the years in the
State.ConclusionIt is concluded from the study that the share ofmajor crops like paddy, groundnut and jowar hasdecreased over the years in the state. However, share ofminor crops like maize, black gram, green gram, coconut
and fruits and vegetable increased over the years. This
shows that state is moving towards crop diversification
rather than specialisation. Based on the compound annual
growth rate of area of crops, it is evident that major crops
like paddy, groundnut and jowar have grown negativelyand least share crops like maize, sugarcane, coconut and
green gram have grown positively over the years. The
crop diversification index value has reduced over the
years. Hence, it is concluded from the study that crop
diversification has been taking place in the state over the
years.REFERENCES(1)Government of Tamil Nadu, Season and CropReport of Tamil Nadu (1980-2007), Directorateof Economics and Statistics, Chennai.(2)Gujarati, Damoder.N. 1992. Basic Econometrics,McGraw Book Company, New York, p.169.March,, 2012657TABLE 1ŠSHARE OF IMPORTANT CROPS IN T

23817640{Phone Nos. :March,, 2012659Labour Use, Farm Size and Productivity Relationship: An Empirical Evidence from Low HillZone of Himachal PradeshSANDEEP KUMAR* AND L. R. VERMA**AbstractHuman labour is an important input and mostdynamic agent of production around which the entire
production process moves, It dominates our agriculture as
most activities are done by hand using traditional tools
and implements, Its utilization varies with the size of farms,
from crop to crop and place to place depending on the
adopted cultural practices, Focusing, specifically, on someselected foodgrain crops which are extensively cultivated
in the study area, in particular, the present paper examinesthe relationship between labour absorption on the one hand
and grosses returns, farm size, crop operations on the other;
and also the question of the labour productivity in
agriculture. The major finding of this study is that at the
existing level of technology, labour was employed beyonda point of maximum productivity and there diminishing
returns are in operation; suggest that agriculture is not in a
position to absorb more labour at the cost of labour
productivity. Similarly, the relationship between size  ofholding and productivity has been the subject of study
since the results of farm management investigation. The
results obtained from the study pointed out that there exists
an inverse relationship between the operational holding
and productivity on maize crop, whereas, constant
productivity relationship was observed  on paddy and
wheat crops. When all these, crops were taken together,inverse relationship between the two holds true, In respect
of profitability, only small farmers are able to convert theiroutput advantage into net profitability by taking all these
crops together. The important policy implication of theanalysis is that the consolidation of land holdings
formulation and effective implementation of a developmant
strategy and management of basic and economic holding
in the study area will undoubtedly of primary importance
to boost agricultural production, productivity and
profitability thereby enhancing the productive employment
and well-being of the farm families.IIntroductionThe population of our country is increasing at a rapid
demand for foodgrain production. In order to fulfill the
growing demand, it has been argued that small farms are*Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, Himachal Pradesh University Regional Centre Daharamshala, 176215..
**Director, Himachal Pradesh University Regional Centre Daharamshala, 176215.more efficient in producing most of the agricultural
commodities, therefore, land distribution in favour of
marginal and small farms is an attractive policy instrument
for raising production, improving rural employment and
quality of income distribution. No doubt, over the past few
years in our country, substantial progress has been madein respect of the performance of agricultural system which
relies more on abolition of intermediaries, ownership right,
security of tenants and ceiling of land holdings. But in
order to formulate the proper policy regarding land reforms,
it is equally important to know the exact relationship
between farm size and productivity in Indian farming. The
debate on the possible relationship between farm size and
productivity was stated by A.K. Sen (1962) in India andlater on joined by Khusro, A.P. Rao, Rudra, HanumantaRao, O.R. Saini and others. Majority of the studies pointed
out that there exists an inverse relationship between the
farm size and productivity. The findings of Directorate ofEconomics and Statistics (1955), Khusro (1964), Krishna
(1964), Sharma (1971), Bardhan (1973), Bhardwaj (1974),
Sankhayan (1978), Saini (1979), Sekar (1994),
Chattopadhyay and Sengupta (1997), and Sharma  & Sharma
(2000) are pioneering in this regard, though they offered
different explanations  in favour of inverse relationship.
On the other hand, a few studies conducted by Singh &
Patel (1973), Ghose (1979), Nagraja (1985) and Reddy (1993),
showed that inverse relationship between the two has
disappeared with the advent of new agricultural strategy
which involved HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, labour
saving machinery, modern irrigation equipment etc.However, the studies made by Rao (1967), Rudra (1968),Rani (1971), Vaidya (1993) in case of wheat crop and SinghBal (1994) indicated that productivity remains constant
irrespective of the difference in holding size. In sum, the
debate on this controversial issue continues to be a moot
point in Indian agriculture.The new agricultural strategy called the HighYielding Variety Programme (HYVP) introduced in the mid-sixties in our country has caused considerable changes in
the trend of area, production and productivity. Thoughthis strategy is confined to a few crops and not with the
same vigour in all parts of the country, it favour large farmbias, however upto a limited extent. It is argued that new
agricultural strategy has displaced the importance of family660Agricultural Situation in Indialabour which was considered to be the main determinant of
inverse relationship between farm size and productivity.The use of chemical fertilizers, HYV seeds, irrigation
facilities along with other infrastructural facilities, process
of liberalization, change in tenancy relations, replacement
of share tenancy with fixed rent tenancy etc., have profound
implication in favour of large farm bias.Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy as itprovides direct employment to more than 60 per cent of the
working population and contributes about one fourth of
the Gross Domestic Product of our country. Agriculture isalso the largest single industry and main occupation of the
people of Himachal Pradesh as 70 per cent of the working
population is directly or indirectly depends upon it and
about 17 per cent of the gross state domestic product comes
from this sector, yet the agriculture sector continues tooccupy a significant place in the State economy and anyfluctuation in the production of foodgrains/Fruits affect
the economy. Such type of dominance of agricultural sectorin the employment structure prompts ones' thoughts on
the possibilities of absorption of additional labour force in
this sector. Several studies [Rao (1976), Ishikawa (1978),Vaidyanathan (1978), Bardhan(1978), Alagh et al. ( 1978),Vyas and Mathai ( 1978), Pandey et al. ( 1981), Gupta (1981),Gowda et al. (1989), Lakshamananet et al. ( 1988)] havemade it clear that agriculture sector has a latent capacityto absorb more labour. on the other hand the studiesconducted by Singh et al. (1981) and Ninan (1984) haveput forward the view that possibilities of more absorption
of labour force in Indian agriculture is fully exhausted at
the present level of technology. The studies conductedby Rathore et al. (1981), Verma (1981), Oberai and ahmed(1981), Lakshmanan et al. (1998), Singh (2000) etc., havesuggested that labour use decline with the increase in
farm size. On the other hand, Naidu  et al. (1981) revealedthat the inverse relation between the two not only
disappeared but turned positive. Similarly, Singh et al(1981) noted that per acre labour input increase with an
increase in the size of holding up to three hectares and
after that it decline for all crops technologies. The same
findings have been reported by Gupta (1981) and Ninan
(1984) too. Therefore, it necessitates for the detailed study
on the pattern and magnitude of labour use across farm
sizes, crops and region to guide the planners about more
absorption of labour force in agriculture. It is in this
background, the present paper seeks to analyze the
pattern and magnitude of human labour employment
potential in selected foodgrain crops and the relationship
between farm size and productivity with the followingspecific objectives :(1)To study the impact of an increase in agriculturaloutput on labour employment.(2)To examine the relationship between farm size andlabour use per unit of area and to know the patternand magnitude of labour absorption across
different crop operations.(3)To find out the relationship between labourproductivity and employment generation.(4)To examine whether farm size is an important factorto determine farm productivity and profitability.(5)To examine the relationship between farm size andproductivity.(6) T
o suggest remedies to increase foodgrainsproduction, productivity and input utilization in
the study area.IIData Source and MethodologyFor the purpose of present study, the entire state wasdivided into three agro-climatic zones viz., low-hill, mid-hill
and high-hill zones based on the height above the mean
sea level. Out of which low-hill zone was purposively

having good production potential, fertile soil, good roads
and communicational network and above all, major
foodgrain crops are grown here. Besides, the agro-climatic
conditions of the low-hill zone are congenial for the
production of foodgrains crops, viz., Maize, Paddy and
Wheat, whereas the mid-hill and high-hill zones, the

production of horticultural and cash crops like, off-season
vegetable, such as potato, cabbage, peas, cauliflower etc.
With the help of random mechanism, two districts, Unaand Bilaspur, have been selected out of which one blockfrom each district, namely, Una and Ghumarwin respectivelywere drawn for the present empirical investigation. Afterthat, three panchayats from each block and three villages
from each panchayat, thus a total of 18 villages have been
selected with the help of multi-stage random sampling. Farms
from each selected village were arranged in the ascending
order on account of their farm size namely, marginal, smalland medium measuring less than 1.0, 1.0-2.0 and 2.0 and
above hectares respectively. The data were collected bysurvey method with the help of pre-tested and well-
structured schedule from 200 farms consisting of 98
marginal, 62 small and 40 medium selected randomly on the
basis of probability proportional to the number of farms in

non-availability of data on some minor crops such as pulses,
mustard, gram etc. we have concentrated in our analysis
only in major foodgrain crops viz., maize, paddy and wheat
which are extensively grown in the study area and when all
these crops were taken together. In order to meet out theobjectives of present work, both linear and log-linear
equations were fitted to the data. In addition to this,
correlation coefficients have also been used to examine
the relationship between labour productivity andMarch,, 2012661employment intensity. More specifically, the following typesof regression equations were fitted to the data :In order to achieve the objectives of present studywe have fitted the following regression equations :H = a+bl Y.. .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. ................. .. . . ... .(i)Log H = log a + bl Y + U................................(ii)Log Y = Log a + bl log Xl + u...............................(iii)Log H = log a + bl log Xl + U...............................(iv)Log M = log a+b1log Xl +u................................(v)Log BTC = log a + bl log  Xl + U ...........................

relationships and its connection with pattern of resource
use on farms, it would be appropriate to have an idea of the
basic characteristics of the study area across different farm
size groups. These characteristics are presented in Table 1in terms of family size, standard mandays, literacy
percentage, sex ratio, farm size, cropping intensity, averageyield, per capita income, average propensity to consume
etc. indicated that there are large variations across farm
size groups.TABLE 1ŠBASIC CHARACTERISTICS - SOME SELECTED INDICATORSS.IndicatorsSize classNo.MarginalSmallMediumOverallholdingholdingholding

function of output here and the results of regression
analysis are presented in Table 2. The results indicate thatall the regression coefficient (linear as well as log-linear) in
each crop and farm size are significant at 1 per cent level.
The linear function indicates the requirement of additionalmandays of labour for a given increase in output whereas
log-linear function measures the employment elasticity with
respect to output. The deviation from unity of all these
elasticity coefficients with the help of ‚t™ test shows that
these coefficients are statistically less than unity indicates
that a one per cent increase in output in each crop and
holding size, leads to a less than proportionate increase in
Labour input per hectare.TABLE 2ŠRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LABOUR INPUT IN MANDAYS (H) AND GROSS V

The results are presented in table 3.The table explores that every hundred rupeesincrease in output will require 0.76, 0.40, 0.31 and 0.36additional mandays of labour for maize, paddy, wheat, andall crops respectively. The employment elasticity withrespect to output is 0.60, 0.55, 0.45, and 0.50 for maize,

strata of farms. The table indicates that marginal farms used
significantly higher amount of humun labour as compared
to their large counterparts in each crop as well as when all
the crops were taken together. The difference in the labouruse between small and medium farms, however significant
only in case of wheat crop cultivation. The inverse
relationship between labour use and farm size can also be
supported by the results of regression analysis. Table 5revealed that all the coefficients are dominated by
significantly negative signs in all the cases. It is indicative
of the fact that inverse relationship between the labour use
and farm size appeared to hold true not in the case of
individual crop but also when all these crops were taken
together. The higher labour intensity on lower size categorymay be due to availability of cheap family labour per unit of
land, the situation arising from low opportunity cost of
labour the fact is that they use less of hired-in labour as
compared to their counterparts.However, in respect bullock labour  tractorizationand manure and fertilizers, marginal farms used significantly
higher amount of respective input factors as compared to
their counterparts in each crop as well as when all the

3. Labour use and crop operationsLabour is an important input entering the productionprocess and hence the pattern and intensity of its use is of
vital importance in agriculture activities from beginning to
the end. The requirement of labour is also vary from crop
depending on the specific cultivation. activities that needs
to be done. Some crop operations are more labour intensive
than others and hence influences the quantum of labour
needed to cultivate various crops. Table 6 presents acomparative picture of human labour input in the cultivationof selected crops with respect to various crop operations.It is evident from the table that per hectare utilizationof human labour is maximum in paddy cultivation followed
by maize and wheat. The higher labour requirement in paddy
and maize crops is mainly due to that these are season-
bound crop and hence during peak season farmers are
obliged to use more of their family as well as hired labour to
complete the various operations well in time without caring
much of marginal contribution. When all these crops were
taken together about 420 days are utilized in the cultivation
of these crops out of which maximum share is appropriated
by inter-culture (quite understandably) followed by land
preparation and transporting. Transporting operations
absorbs more employment due to the fragmented and
scattered holdings thereby increase the distance between
farmers™ house and from plot to plot, thus putting more
pressure  on manual transport due to hilly area.TABLE 6ŠPATTERN OF HUMAN LABOUR DAYS UTILIZATION(Standard mandays per hectare) .S.ItemsCropsNo.MaizePaddyWheatAll crops(maize+paddy+wheat)1.Land preparation16.1317.3519.4752.95

compared to other crops.
4. Labour Productivity and Employment GenerationLabour productivity in agriculture is an importantissue of labour use itself. Increasing labour productivityis of vital importance from the policy point of view to
generate additional employment opportunities. Table 7explores the data pertaining to average labour productivity
in rupees per manday of labour employed. Average labourproductivity increase with the increase in size of holding
from marginal to small and then declines from small to
medium not in the case of all crops but the individual
crops also.TABLE 7ŠAVERAGE LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE, PADDY, WHEAT AND A

666Agricultural Situation in IndiaLabour productivity is higher for wheat crop thanthat of maize and paddy in all size classes. But it does not
mean that labour use efficiency in wheat crop is more than
that of its counterparts. The fact is that the cultivation of
wheat crop requires less quantum of labour unlike paddy
and maize cultivation, however land productivity is much
higher in case of paddy and maize crop than wheat crop
and both these crops are labour intensive crops thereby
pushing down the average labour productivity.The correlation coefficients between labour inputin mandays per hectare and average labour productivity
per mandays were -0.62 (taking into account all the 189

observations) -0.51 (542 observations) in case of maize,
paddy, wheat and all crops respectively. All thesecorrelation coefficients are statistically significant at I percent level, thus suggest that average labour productivity
would increase significantly only if per hectare labour
input were to decline. In other way, it can be concludedthat at the present level of technology, labour is employedin agriculture beyond a point of maximum productivity
and thereby diminishing returns are in operation.5. Farm size and ProductivityThe gross return of maize, paddy, wheat and all cropsare given in Table 8. The data indicated that the grossreturns from maize, paddy, wheat as well as all crops aresignificantly higher on marginal farms as compared to the
small and medium farmers. Similarly, the gross returns werealso higher on small farms as compared to medium farmers
except in wheat crop.TABLE 8ŠFARM SIZE AND GROSS OUTPUT OF DIFFERENT CROPSSl.CropsMarginalSmall holdingMedium't' value for differenceNo.holdingholdingMeanStandardMeanStandardMeanStandardMarginalMarginal

of regression analysis (Table 9) showed the negative effectof farm size on productivity in case of maize and when all
the crops were taken together, however the effect waspositive in case of paddy and negative for wheat though
insignificant.Thus, inverse relationship between farm size
and productivity is a confirmed phenomenon the area under
study.6. Farm size and ProfitabilityIn the present analysis, profitability is defined asthe value of net returns which is obtained by deducting
the total cost (all cash and kind expenses incurred on
material inputs, rental value of owned land, rent on
owned fixed capital, imputed value of owned family
labour etc.) from the gross returns. Net returns are
presented in Table 10.March,, 2012667TABLE 10ŠNET RETURNS(per hectare)Sl.CropsFarm SizeNo.Marginal farmersSmall farmersMedium farmersOverall farmers1.Maize(Œ)7382.61(Œ) 2941. 98(Œ)3534.17(Œ) 4260.542.Paddy1884.935796.373375.694487.20

inadequate knowledge and lack of motivation. Further, thecultivation of these crops gave a good amount of loss
except paddy crop. As between the farms in different sizeclasses, only small farmers are able to convert their output
advantageously into net profit, however it is negative in
respect of maize crop but the loss of amount is less than
their countarparts. The negative returns on maize crop may
be attributed to the low value of crop yield whereas, low
yield rate was responsible for the same on wheat crop. The
cultivation of paddy crop required good quality of muddy
soil without any slope in the field. Therefore, farmers
irrespective of any farm size category put better application
of available resources for the cultivation of paddy crop,
which is reflected in high yield rate as compared to maize
and what crops. That is why, there are positive returns inpaddy crop.IVConcluding ObservationsTo sum up, an increase in productivity will lead to aless than proportionate increase in the levels of labour use
however the impact of increase of the productivity on labour
absorption varies across crops and strata of holdings.
Secondly, the inverse relationship between the per hectarelabour use and size of holding was observed in each crop
as well as when all these crop were treated together as
confirmed from the results of regression analysis. However,the difference of labour use between the small and medium
farms was significant only in case of wheat crop. The
proportion of hired labour was founded to be directly related
with the size of holding. Thirdly, crop operations likeweeding/ inter-culture/holding, land preparation,
transporting and harvesting were found to be more labour
intensive operations in each crop. Similarly, in case of maizeand paddy crops, labour absorption was much higher than
wheat crop in each size class. Lastly, an increase in thelabour absorption may be at the cost of labour productivity.As our result indicated that average labour productivity
would rise only if per hectare labour input were to decline.
The crux of the problem of increasing employment at the
present level of technology without producing a decline inlabour productivity is an important issue to be settled. The
only way out for increasing both the productivity and
employment is to upgrade the present level of technology.Similarly, the inverse relationship between the farmsize and productivity was observed in maize crop whereas,
constant productivity relationship was observed in case
of paddy and wheat crops. When all these crops were
taken together, inverse relationship between the two holdstrue. The results further explored that marginal farms used
higher amount of human labour, bullock labour andtractorization and manure & fertilizers as compared to higher
farm size categories. The existing inverse relationship
between farm size and productivity is mainly due to the
higher input intensity on other farm size categories as
compared to lower size category. The marginal farms usemore amount of labour per unit of land because of
availability of cheap family labour. The situation arisingfrom low opportunity cost of labour, the fact is that theyuse less of hired in labour as compared to their large
counterparts. Similarly, the intensity of bullock labour &tractorization was also found higher on smaller sized
categories of farms due to willingness to get profit and
higher availability of bullock labour per unit of land as
compared to large farm size category. Further, land fertilitywas also higher on lower sized categories due to the higher
availability of farmyard manure per unit of land for them. In
other way, they have large number of cattle per hectare.The situation becomes worse for larger farm size category
as there was no market for farmyard manure. However, theintroduction of chemical fertilizers has eroded the
importance of farmyard manure, yet it is equally required
for retaining and enhancing the soil fertility along with
balanced fertilizer (N+P+K). In broader terms, the results
obtained from the study support the hypothesis of inverse
relationship between farm size and productivity however,in respect of individua1 crops, the effect of farm size on
productivity was size neutral in case of paddy and wheat
crops. As far as the net return  to farming is concerned, themarginal farmers are not able to convert their output
advantages into higher net profits due to their higher total
costs. In other way, the viability of marginal farmers interms of net returns is not as strong as in the case of output.
Similarly, medium farmers also not getting profits despite668Agricultural Situation in Indiatheir low cost, mainly due to the low yield rates. On the
other hand, small farmers are not only getting positive
returns but also minimizing the amount of loss on maize
crop as compared to their counterparts. Therefore, in the
light of declining net returns from farming, especially of
marginal and medium farms, the viability of farming need to
be improved It necessitates for the consolidation of land
holding, management of basic and  economic holding and
introduction of an integrated development strategy
encompassing both its production and marketing aspects

viz profitable enterprise. For this, there is inevitable need
to tone up, strengthen and modernize the extension network
to transfer the production technology and technical

capacity. Besides, a multidimensional approach coveringoptimum farm plans, soil conservation, water harvesting
animal raising, effective crop insurance scheme etc, was
badly needed to increase productive employment in
agriculture which is believe to be the key of accelerated
development thereby the well-being of farm families. The
emphasis should also be laid down on some areas such as
efficient use of resources, delivery of critical inputs at the
right time and place, flow of institutional credit,
development of irrigation facilities, development of high
yield variety seeds, programmes for stray-animals, effective
policy related to women etc.REFERENCESBalisther and Singh, R.K. (1981), ﬁLabour Absorption  underdifferent levels of Technology used inAgricutltureﬂ, Indian Journal of AgriculturalEconomics, V

Agro-Economic ResearchPossibilities and Constraints in Increasing Pulses Production in Andhra Pradesh andthe Impact of National Food Security Mission on Pulses*Executive Summary*AERC, Andhra University VisakhapatnamPulses production has received the attention ofgovernment and public in recent years, in response to
soaring consumer prices. Global shortages in pigeon pea
(Tur dal production have occurred in recent years. Prices
of Tur dal increased nearly four fold during the last five
years (2005-09). Price of Tur dal, which used to be
Rs. 24-32/kg during 2005, had increased to Rs.l00/kg in
December 2009. Demand is rising with increase in
population as well as rise in purchasing power of the rural
people due to NREGS, ADWDR etc. The area under pulsesstarted declining even in the pre High Yield Varieties (HYV)era. Pulses did not get its due share even in respect of
increases in irrigation. The crop has failed to keep pace
with the demand of population.
Need for the Study :Nearly 23 million hectares of pulses crops have beenraised in India producing 1.4 million tonnes of pulses grains.
The pulses sector in India at present is characterized by
short supply, high prices and high dependence on imports.India is the largest producer and consumer of pulses in the
World accounting for about 25 per cent of their globalproduction, 27 per cent of their global consumption and
about 33 per cent of World's area under pulses. However,production performance of pulses in India has remained
stagnant.When prices are rising, it is logical that there is anincentive for farmers to produce more of these crops to
earn higher incomes. Productivity of pulses in India has
stagnated at 622kg/ha compared to yield of 1908kg/ha in
Canada/USA due to the vagaries of monsoon, problem in
the availability of good quality approved HYV seeds, low
seed replacement rate etc.
National Food Security Mission (NFSM) :The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) waslaunched in the state from Rabi 2007-08 after the state level
Executive Committee decision, with the objective of
increasing production and productivity of Rice and Pulses
on a sustainable basis to ensure food crops security. Theapproach is to bridge the yield gap in respect of these
crops through dissemination of improved technologies and
farm management practices. It is envisaged to focus on
districts which have high potential but relatively low level
of productivity performance at present. Under the Missionthere are series of program intervention efforts to reach
resource poor farmers and continuous monitoring of
various activities.
Objectives :
To
(1)Analyze returns from cultivation of pulses vis-a-
vis competing crops(2)Analyze the other major problems and prospects
for pulse cultivation(3)Assess the impact, if any, of NFSM pulses.Methodology :For the survey of primary data Prakasam district underNFSM and Ranga reddy district outside NFSM are selected.
Ervaguda village from Sankarampally mandal is selected
from Ranga reddy district and from Prakasam district
Veerannapalem is selected from Parachur mandaI. From eachvillage 50 farmers comprising small, marginal, SC/ST,Women farmers are selected using PPS sampling.Using secondary data growth trends of pulses andmajor competing crops since 1990 are calculated on the
aspects of area, production, yield, and irrigated area, area
under improved varieties, prices and procurement. Time
series data on pulses are collected from the ﬁSeason and
Crop Reportsﬂ and "Statistical Abstracts of A.P. publishedby the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government
of Andhra Pradesh. The reference period for the study is2006-07 to 2008-09.
Growth Tr
ends of Pulses in  A. P. :In A.P., there is a stable growth trend for Bengalgram and Red gram during the study period. It is unbalanced
for Green gram and Black gram in Coastal Andhra andRayalaseema, while Telangana shows strong growth trendduring 1990-08. The Horse gram and ‚Other Pulses™ show
declining trend across A.P. The Rabi fallows of irrigateddistricts viz East and West Godavari, Krishna and Gunturare the best for pulses growth as a third crop, though there
is commercial crops are cultivated, provided suitable seed
variety and manual labour saving devices (suitable
mechanization in cultivation) to the farmers in this area.
The whole picture of   '‚Total Pulses™  appear bleak in Coastal672Agricultural Situation in IndiaAndhra compared to Rayalaseema and Telangana. It is muchappropriate to implement the required policies across
Coastal Andhra particularly, for Green gram and Black gram.Profile of sample Area and Farmers :Prakasam :Prakasam district is one among the 14 districts selectedunder National Food Security Mission (NFSM) under
Pulses Programme. Rice is the major crop in the district
accounting for 19.78 per cent in gross cropped area followed
by Bengal gram (14.10 per cent) Tobacco (12.31 per cent).Red gram (10.29 per cent) Cotton (6.14 per cent) and
Sunflower (6.02 per cent). Bengal gram is cultivated in 94000
ha forming 15 per cent of state™s area under the crop. Similarly15 per cent of area i.e., 68000 ha. under, Red gram in thestate is in Prakasam district. Notably, forty eight per cent ofthe area under Tobacco crop in the state is in Prakasamdistrict. An area of 677 ha of pulses crop is under irrigationthough there is no irrigation for Red gram and Bengal gram.
Ranga Reddy :Ranga Reddy district is selected for the study as it isnot covered under NFSM pulses but has a predominant
pulses cropŠRed gram. The Principal crops in the district
are paddy, Jowar, Maize, Cotton, Castor, Pulses andVegetables. Red gram with a cropped area of 33000 ha (14.82per cent in GCA) is the leader in the un-irrigated land
followed by Maize with 30000 ha (13.36 per cent) and Jowar
with 24000 ha. (10.51 per cent). Rice is cultivated in 32000
ha (14.29 per cent) in the irrigated land. About 33000 tonnesof Red gram, nearly 7.45 per cent of the state's production,
comes from Ranga Reddy district.
Cropping Pattern :Bengal gram is the leading crop in Prakasam districtwith 77.38 ha. It is followed by Tobacco and Paddy with23.31 ha. and 10.93 ha. respectively. Red gram is cultivatedin 3.91 hectares. The others are Jowar and fodder crops.
While Paddy is cultivated in exclusively irrigated area,
Bengal gram is raised in unirrigated land, that too in the
Rabi season. The major crops in Kharif season are Tobaccoand Rice being cultivated in 23.91 (48.66 percent) 10.93 ha.
(22.43 per cent) respectively. Other crops are Jowar, Redgram (20.89 per cent) and some vegetable crops. Rice is the
most preferred crop among the marginal farmers with 89.01
per cent of their cropped area under its cultivation. Tobaccofound favour in the other size groups. On the overall, I
Tobacco leads by 48.66 percent followed by Rice with 22.43percent and other crops like Jowar and Vegetables. Redgram is being cultivated by medium and small farmers with
22.15 percent and 6.31 percent of land allocated for the
crop.In Rabi season farmers in the sample grow onlyBengal gram in Prakasam district. The area under this crop
is generally left fallow in Kharif season so that the yieldwould be better. Maize is the leading crop being grown in45.12 ha followed by Pulses crop Red gram with 28.28
hectares. These two crops account for 44.53 per cent and
27.88 per cent respectively in the net cropped area. Anotherfood crop, Rice is grown in 10.93 hectares covering 10.79
per cent to total kharif crop being grown by the sample
farmer. Cotton is grown in 14.20 hectares accounting for14.01 per cent of the net cropped area. In all the size groups
Maize was given priority as far as cropped area is concerned.
Bengal gram is the only crop raised in Rabi season in Maize
fallows. There is not much variation in area under the crop.
Total area is 5.60 hectares.Pulses Crops :Out of the total cropped area under Pulses in district95.19 per cent is occupied by Bengal gram while the rest is
under Red gram. Marginal and Large farmers are exclusively
cultivating Bengal gram among the sample households in
this district. About 14.82 per cent of  medium farmers and3.11 per cent of small farmers are also growing Red gram.Red gram, the major crop, is raised in 28.28 hectaresaccounting for 83.47 per cent of the cropped area under
Pulses. Though this crop is normally raised as a mixed crop
with Jowar and Maize. It is also raised as mono crop. Bengal
gram, sown mainly in kharif fallows accounts for 16.53 per
cent of the area under pulses. This practice is more popular
among marginal farmers with 29.47 per cent followed by
large farmer group (16.00 per cent) and small (14.58 per
cent).ECONOMICS OF PULSES CULTIVATIONNFSM District - Prakasam :
Bengal gram :Bengal gram is exclusively cultivated in the rabiseason and area under the crop is mostly left fallow in
kharif. Large scale seed distribution was taken up in the
district on 50 per cent subsidy. The crop seems to be notpopular among marginal farmers as it was discontinued in
2007-08 and 2008-09. Its area is more or less stable in large
farmer group while it shows oscillation in small and medium
farmers' group. Gross returns per hectare have shown an
increasing trend over farm size groups ranging from Rs.
40363 in marginal group to Rs. 54,006 in large farmer group.
Overall per hectare gross return is Rs. 47178 among the
sample farmers.
Tobacco :Tobacco is the main commercial crop of the regionand widely cultivated among the sample households. For
the Triennium Ending (TE) 2006-09 about 23.71 hectares
are under Tobacco cultivation. The cropped area is stablein large and medium farmers and oscillation is there among
marginal and small farmers. While area under the crop
remained the same for marginal farmers in the study period,March,, 2012673it increased in all the other three groups, i.e., for small,
medium and large farmers in 2008-09. Gross returns per
hectare ranges from Rs. 41184 for marginal farmer group toRs. 78,107 hectare for farmers in the medium group. At thesame time small size group farmers are realizing higher net
income, i.e., 36.64 per cent of the gross income with a
relatively low percentage of 63.36 of paid out costs. For
marginal farmers the percentage of paid out costs in the
gross income is 78 per cent resulting in low net income at
22 per cent. On the overall, farmers of Tobacco crop get Rs.68281 gross income per hectare out of which 64.98 per cent
goes as paid out costs.
Non-NFSM Ranga Reddy District :
Red gram :Red gram is the major pulse crop in the Districtcultivated in kharif season. It is traditionally raised as mixed
crop with food crops like Maize and Jowar. In the recentpast it is also raised as mono crop. The cropped area under
Red gram is stable in the study period 2006-09 for all groups.
Gross return per hectare for the crop varied from Rs. 27,890
to Rs. 42,411. Though gross returns are high at Rs. 42,411
in medium size group it received lower percentage of net
returns as their paid out costs are high at 41. 72 per cent in
the gross. Large farmer size group incurred lowest paid out
costs at 33.68 per cent and received highest net returns i.e.,
66.83 per cent of gross income. On the whole the gross
returns received on the crop are Rs. 31,165 out of which
62.57 per cent is the net income. The larger farmer group is
able to sell more at the market and reported that 91.49 per
cent of the gross value is for sale. The acceleration trend is
there for gross returns per ha to all size groups and vice-
versa for paid-out costs to all farmer groups during 2006-
09. Therefore, the Red gram cultivation has led to increasing
trend for Net returns per ha/per Qtl for whole study period.
The paid-out costs are very less to large farmers followed
by marginal farmers and consequently these groups have
better edge in net returns.
Cotton :Cotton is cultivated in 14.20 hectares accounting for14 per cent of the total cropped area by sample farmers.
Area under the crop did not undergo any change in the
study period in all the size groups. Though the returns are
not comparable with pulses where hike in prices is seen,
farmers feel that the crop is dependable as its returns are
not that susceptible to weather and pests. Gross returns
per hectare varied from Rs. 9,320 in large size group to
Rs. 10,827 in the small size group. Lowest of Rs. 8,135/ha is
reported in medium group. Percentage of net returns in
gross returns is the highest in marginal group at 32.56 and
the lowest in medium group at 25.41. When the sample is
considered as a whole gross returns per hectare is reported
as Rs. 9,832 out of which 71.00 per cent has gone out as
costs resulting in net return of 29.00 per cent (Table 4.6).Paid-out costs as a percentage in gross returns declinedfrom year to year in the study period in all farm size groups.
In the same manner, as a consequence as well, net returnshave consistently increased in the same period over all
size groups.
Bengal gram :Bengal gram occupies second place in pulse cropsin Rangareddy district. It is mostly raised in Maize fallows
in Rabi season. Area under the crop is stable over theperiod across all farm size groups. Gross returns per hectare
varied from Rs. 18,251 in small size group to Rs. 21,458 in
marginal group. Overall TE average is Rs. 19,491. About45.95 per cent of this is paid out costs leaving a margin of
54.05 per cent as net income on the whole. The percentage
of paid out costs is high in large farmer group at 54.32. On
the contrary marginal farmer size group is receiving a high
income at 58.94 per cent. This could be attributed to higher
participation of family labour in farming which would in
turn out the paid out costs. Consistent increase in net
income is observed only in medium farmer group in the
study period. Marginal farmers are keeping more of the
produce for seed and home consumption thereby having
lower percentage of market surplus at 64.51. Medium farmers
report the highest market surplus percentage of 89.46. The
overall market surplus ratio is 79.92.
Profitability of Pulses vis-a-vis other crops :In Prakasam (NFSM) district only paddy is raised inIrrigated lands. While Tobacco is raised in un-irrigatedlands in kharif season, Bengal gram is raised in Rabi season.
Bengal gram is the only crop raised in that land as it is left
fallow in kharif season. Naturally yields in this district are
high and net returns on the crop surpasses Tobacco andPaddy. But the investment on Tobacco is much higher about154 per cent, than the Bengal gram. Even when compared
with paddy the farmers are realizing 84 per cent higher net
income on Bengal gram. In Ranga reddy district, which is
selected as non-NFSM district in the reference year, Redgram is the principal pulse crop. Thanks for the spike in
prices it outstripped the other crops like Rice, Cotton, Maize
and even secondary pulse crop Bengal gram in net income.
The profit on the Red gram is 294.70 per cent more than
Maize, 239.86 per cent more than Cotton and 76.28 per cent
more than Rice.
Technology adoption and marketing :NFSM District - Prakasam :
Seed :Improved varieties of seeds are widely popular amongthe sample households. Agriculture department is alsosupplying Bengal gram seed varieties like Annegiri andLaxmi on 50 per cent subsidy under NFSMŠPulses
programme. All the sample farmers, irrespective of theirland holding size, are cultivating improved varieties of
Bengal gram. The awareness and acceptance is 100 per674Agricultural Situation in Indiacent. While the marginal farmers are cultivating improved
varieties of Bengal gram in 13.76 hectares, the large farmers
have 29.14 hectares under the same category. Overall 86.32hectares of sample farmers are under improved varieties of
Bengal gram, which means 100 per cent adoption of new
technology.To reap full benefits of the improved varieties, therecommended cultivation practices are to be followed bythe farmers. When delved in to this aspect it was found
that sowing practices were followed by 40 per cent of sample
farmers, 28 per cent followed seed practices while other 16
per cent did not follow any. About 20 per cent of marginalfarmers and an equal percentage of medium farmers did not
follow any recommended practices. Though the penetration
of improved varieties of seeds in pulses crops is 100 per
cent problems that are still bothering the farmer community
are enumerated. About 60 per cent of medium farmers and50 per cent of large farmers feel that yield levels of the
improved varieties are not up to the expectations. The same
opinion is conveyed by 30 per cent of the overall groups.
Pest resistance :When it comes to pest resistance 40 per cent inmedium group and 25 per cent each in marginal and large
group expressed that improved varieties did not perform
well. 22 per cent of overall sample concurred with that
opinion. Though 50 per cent subsidy is given on seed
under NFSM 35 per cent of the reported households under
marginal group felt the cost of the seed is still high and
must be brought down. Another 20 per cent of overallsample, who reported problems, said the seed though
available is not supplied on time. About 60 per cent inmedium group and 50 per cent in large group felt that yield
performance is lower than expected. As the time of sowingis very crucial, 71 per cent of the overall sample farmers
have asked for timely availability of seed at low prices of
genuine seed.
Marketing :In Prakasam district, where NFSM programme is beingimplemented, farmers are not utilizing the regulated market
for pulses. They are not convinced of fair price for their
crop after incurring transport costs and an arduous wait at
the yard. Once the produce is taken to the yard they feel
that they are at the mercy of the unscrupulous traders as
they can not wait there indefinitely for a good price. Instead
they are selling the pulses at their own home to a
Commission agent at their chosen time. If the market prices
are low some of the farmers who can wait are choosing to
stock their crop at a cold storage in near by mandal head
quarters. This practice has become more common in recent
years as it helps in retaining the colour of the produce.
Another advantage they are citing is that the stock at the
storage can be pledged to a bank for a loan to tide over any
immediate financial needs. When the prices go up they candispose off the stock from the cold storage to a commission
agent and pay the bank loan if any. In Prakasam district allthe marketable surplus is sold through commission agents
only. Regulated markets. There is no market interventionby government agencies like NAFED in the region. Amongthe size groups large farmers, who can wait for a better
price, received the higher price of Rs. 2,999 followed by
medium farmers with Rs. 2,706. The marginal farmers who
can not wait for long for better price got the lowest price of
Rs. 2,357.
Non-NFSM - DistrictŠRanga Reddy : Seed varieties :Adoption of HYV seed is 100 per cent in the sizegroups of medium and large farmers. About 85 per cent ofarea under Red gram of small farmers and 91 per cent of
land of marginal farmers are under HYV pulses. On the
whole the adoption rate of HYV seed is 95 per cent among
the sample farmers. But agricultural officials assert that
there is no traditional variety being cultivated now. Farmersare well aware of seed varieties under HYV.Recommended Practices :Recommended sowing practices were followed by70 per cent of medium farmers and 50 per cent of small and
large farmers. Half of the large farmer group, 20 per cent
each of medium farmers and marginal farmers are following
good seed practices. Other recommended practices like
proper doses of fertilizers, weeding and plant protection
measures are being followed by 25 per cent of large farmers
and 20 per cent of medium farmers. On the whole 42 per
cent are adopting sowing practices, 22 per cent are following
seed practices and another 14 per cent are implementing
other practices like fertilizer and pesticide application. But
at the end, quite a proportion of 44 per cent are not following
any recommended practices.Farmers are asked whether they had any problemsor apprehensions with HYVs and to suggest some
solutions. More prominent among the problems are lower
yields as reported by 43 per cent of sample farmers. Small
farmers (69 per cent) followed by marginal farmers .(60
per cent) are more vocal in expressing their opinion.
Majority of marginal farmers, 75 per cent, followed by
small farmers, 38 per cent, felt that the seeds are very
expensive. Fifty per cent of marginal farmers, 25 per cent
of small farmers and 20 per cent of medium farmers share
the view that HYVs also need higher doses of fertilizers
and pesticides. Availability of seed is not a big issue withthe farmers. Only 10 per cent felt that the seeds are not
available on time. When asked to suggest solutions for
pulses crop improvement 80 per cent of marginal farmers
said that they need cheaper seeds or subsidy on prices.
This view was shared by'38 per cent of small farmers and
20 per cent of medium farmers. About 20 per cent of samplefarmers felt that the quality of seed must be monitored by
agricultural officials.March,, 2012675Marketing :Large farmers seem to be more equipped in dealingwith market forces as they realize higher prices, Rs. 4,369
per quintal, for their crop. Another reason for this is theirability to wait for better price. The marginal farmers, on the
other hand could realize only Rs. 4,134 per quintal. The
medium and small farmers could get only Rs. 4,266 and
Rs. 4,254 respectively.Farmer™s Perceptions :
Pest problems :Farmers reported considerable loss due to pod borerand wilt to Bengal gram and Red gram in NFSM and Non-
NFSM districts Damage due to pod borer is reported by 46
per cent of Bengal gram cultivators in NFSM district and
60 per cent of Red gram cultivators of Non-NFSM district.
Estimated crop loss is 18 per cent in Bengal gram and 22
per cent in Red gram. Wilt is also reported to be causingdamage 32 per cent of Bengal gram farmers with a crop loss
of 15 per cent. Red gram crop in Non-NFSM district also
suffered a loss of 15 per cent affecting 42 per cent of farmers.
Reasons for growing pulses :The reasons enlisted areŠtraditional habit, homeconsumption, the inferior quality of land and profitability.While all farmers across size groups expressed the need of
pulses for consumption at home, 50 per cent in large farmer
group, 31 per cent in small group 20 per cent each in medium
and marginal farmers group felt that the unsuitability due
to inferior quality of land to raise other crops made them
take up pulses cultivation. In NFSM - Prakasam district, all
the farmers in large, medium groups, 75 per cent in marginal
and 63 per cent in small groups have said that they couldget some cash for domestic expenditure by raising pulses.
All the farmers in Ranga Reddy district (Non-NFSM), who
raise Red gram, have responded that they need the crop
for home consumption. Similarly all of them have said
that the inferior quality of land also prompted them to go
for the crop. Profitability was the motive for 90 per cent of
marginal, small and 75 per cent of large farmers expressed
the same.
Limitations in area expansion :Few questions were directed at the sample farmersto find out the reasons for low area under pulses crops. In
NFSM district problem of pests is the leading factor as
expressed by 77 per cent of farmers followed by low
profitability (56 per cent) and instability of prices or yield
(47 per cent). About 29 per cent have also said thatmarketing problem is also a hurdle. In Non-NFSM district
where Red gram is cultivated, majority of farmers (83 per
cent) are bothered about low yields followed by pest
problem (69 per cent), instability of prices and yield (68 per
cent), low profitability (36 per cent) and marketing problems
(18 per cent). In NFSM district 50 per cent of pulses farmersin large group, 21 per cent in medium group, 18 per cent in
marginal group followed by 14 per cent of small farmers are
willing to expand the area under pulses if assured market is
provided and competitive prices offered. In similar pattern
75 per cent of large farmers, 15 per cent of medium farmers
have shown interest in area expansion in the scenario of
assured market. Similar views are shared by 12 per cent of
small farmers and 5 per cent of marginal farmers in non-
NFSM district.Major problems that are plaguing the cultivators ofpulses are low yields, lack of improved varieties and lack of
irrigation in some areas. Low yield is the major problem
according to 64 per cent of farmers in NFSM area. This is
even a bit higher in Non-NFSM area (72 per cent). High
Pest incidence is reported by 14 per cent in NFSM area and
by 16 per cent in Non-NFSM area. Low market price is
bothering 6 per cent of farmers in NFSM area and 8 per
cent in Non-NFSM area. About 6 per cent of NFSM farmersand 4 per cent of Non-NFSM farmers feel that the seed
they use is not of improved variety or of spurious quality.Suggestions are sought to increase area under pulses.
Assured marketing through government procurement
agencies with minimum support price seems to be the main
concern of 90  per cent of Bengal gram farmers in NFSM
district. Another 88 per cent of farmers have voiced thatreasonable market price must be maintained to encourage
pulses farmers. Same view is also shared by 72 per cent of
Non-NFSM farmers of Red gram. Pest resistant varieties
are the need of the hour according to 36 per cent of Non-
NFSM farmers and 14 per cent of NFSM farmers. About 6per cent in NFSM area and 4 per cent in Non-NFSM area
have suggested that high yielding varieties of certified
seed must be readily made available on time.
Implementation of NFSMŠPulses :
Distribution of Certified Seed :Recognizing the use of certified seed as the basicstep to realize higher yields, a major chunk of the funds are
allocated and utilized under NFSM. During 2007-08 Rabiseason, when the NFSM pulses was first launched there
was 100 per cent achievement all across the pulses growing
districts. A total of Rs. 1,060 lakhs was spent on certifiedseed distribution for the Rabi season. In the next year,2008-09, though district-wise breakup was not available,
280 per cent achievement was shown over the target and
an amount of Rs. 3,269 lakhs was expended. This amount
was increased by 11 per cent and reached to Rs. 3,720 in
the next year, i.e., 2009-10.Integrated Nutrient Management :Under this programme Lime/Gypsum is supplied tothe farmers at 50 per cent subsidy with a limit of Rs. 750 per
hectare. Zinc is also supplied similarly at 50 per cent cost
with a limit of Rs. 500 per ha. In the first year, 2007-08 theprogramme was sluggish and implemented only in676Agricultural Situation in IndiaSrikakulam, East Godavari, Nizamabad and Adilabad. Exceptin Nizamabad where the financial achievement was only 74
per cent, in all other districts it was a success with 100 per
cent achievement In the next year, i.e., 2008-09 theachievements under this head are not so impressive. Except
in Nizamabad, where it was 254 per cent, in the other eight
districts the program was not satisfactory. In the remaining5 districts the performance was less than 50 per cent. In
many of the districts there is a mismatch between physical
and financial achievements and the later being lower than
the former. In 2009-10 the figures show a uniform 100 percent achievement all across the districts.
Supply of SSP :The supply of (SSP) is reported to have been doneonly in the first year. A complete performance was recordedin Srikakulam, Krishna and Ananthapur while it was only50 per cent in Nizamabad. Prakasam has shown 14 per cent
achievement. In all other districts there was no supply. Thetotal amount spent was 33 lakhs.
Integrated Pest Management :In 2007-08 Rs. 187.5 lakhs were spent under theprogramme and achieved a 100 per cent performance in all the
districts. In the later years,  i.e., 2008-09 though the expenditureincreased to Rs. 401 lakhs its performance registered not soimpressive pattern. In half of the districts the financial
performance is more than 80 per cent The programme was not
implemented in Srikakulam district. In 2009-10 Prakasam,
Nizamabad and Mahaboobnagar districts recorded 100 per
cent performance in Pest Management programme.
Sprayers :Sprayers were supplied as part of the PestManagement Programme at Rs. 3,000 subsidy. In the firstyear Rs. 314 lakhs were spent on distribution of sprayers
but district-wise breakup of expenditure was not available.
In 2008-09 no funds were allocated for the scheme. However
in the next year, i.e., in 2009-10 only 75 lakhs were spent forthe scheme. Except Prakasam where the performance was
73 per cent, others have registered 9 to 34 per cent
achievement only.Sprinkler Sets :For effective water management Sprinkler sets weresupplied to the farmers at 50 per cent subsidy of the cost
limited to Rs. 7,500 per. hectare. The scheme was a successin Nizamabad. Nalgonda and Adilabad in 2007-08.Khammam registered 59 per cent achievement. Seven
districts Srikakulam, East Godavari, Krishna, Kurnool,
Kadapa, Mahaboobnagar and Warangal did not receiveany funds under this scheme in the same year. Guntur,Prakasam and Ananthapur performed poorly at 7 and 14per cent achievement. Overall, only 11 lakhs were spent in
2007-08. Srikakulam, Nalgonda and Adilabad were the majorbeneficiaries in 2008-09 under the scheme. Eight districtsdid not receive any funds under this scheme. Totalexpenditure was 31 lakhs in the year. This has gone up to104 lakhs in 2009-10. Guntur, Mahaboobnagar andWarangal which did not get enough allocation earlier gotbenefited in this year. Srikakulam, Guntur, Nizamabad haveachieved 100 per cent of the targets while Khammam and
Adilabad outperformed at 138 and 316 per cent respectively.Diesel Pump sets :Distribution of Diesel pump sets was taken up in2009-10 to bring more area under irrigation and to boost
the yields. An amount of Rs. 674 lakhs was spent in thestate. Except Ananthapur and Kadapa all 12 remainingdistricts were brought under the programme. East Godavari
and Prakasam were the major beneficiaries by receiving
214 and 143 lakhs respectively. About 6 districts performedextremely well by registering 300 to 800 per cent
achievement in the financial target in the year. The othershave also done well with 100 to 200 per cent.
Vermi-Compost Units :To encourage organic farming vermi-compost unitsare encouraged in all the pulses growing districts by
spending 200 lakhs. Each unit was given Rs. 20,000 for
establishing and maintenance. All the districts werebenefited under the scheme and recorded 100 per cent
financial achievement in 2009-10. Vermi hatcheries weresanctioned at a cost of 30 lakhs by providing financial help
of Rs. 75,000 per unit to enthusiastic farmers. Even this
programme was extended to all districts and they in turn
have fully utilized the funds.
Seed Drills :In support of farm mechanization seed drills andRotovators were also distributed under NFSM programme
in 2009-10. Ananthapur, Mahaboobnagar, Kadapa, andKurnool districts received these machinery at a total cost
of 27 lakhs. Ananthapur has recorded 470 per cent financialachievement while Guntur failed at 2 per cent.
Rotavators :Nizamabad, Mahaboobnagar, Kadapa andAnanthapur districts were given priority under the
programme. It was also successfully implemented in
Ananthapur district. An amount of Rs. 8 Lakhs was incurredunder this head in 2009-10.
Impact of NFSM Pulses:All the cultivators irrespective of their size group areaware of NFSM Pulses program as the program is noticed
by 100 per cent awareness.
Seed Supply :Seed is distributed to all farmers in the sample on 50per cent subsidy. Everyone, irrespective of land holding isbenefited under the scheme. Some demonstration farmsMarch,, 2012677were also developed to showcase the effective crop
management. Training was also imparted in seed treatment
and crop husbandry to 58 per cent of marginal farmers in
the sample NFSMŠPulses program found favour with all
the small farmers as everyone was benefited by the seed
distribution programme.
Benefits accrued :Among the other benefits that the sample farmers ofNFSM programme reported are higher yields, reduced pest
problem and knowledge of crop husbandry. Majority, 70 percent of marginal farmers and the same percentage of medium
farmers have reported that they were benefited through
higher yields. Even in small and large farmer group more
than half of them expressed the same. Overall 66 per cent got
higher yields. About 70 per cent of medium farmers, 56 percent of small and 50 per cent of marginal farmers expressed
that pest problem was considerably reduced. On the whole
54 per cent opined the same. Eighty per cent of medium
farmers responded by saying that they are enriched by the
crop management practices demonstrated by the NFSM
programme. However, this feeling was shared by only 30 percent of marginal farmers and 25 per cent of large farmers.
Overall 36 per cent of farmers concurred with them.Production also increased in Bengal gram due toNFSM Programme. Highest growth is observed in medium
group farmers at 68.10 per cent followed by 35.04 per cent
in large farmer group and 26.38 per cent in marginal group.
The lowest per cent of 12.44 is recorded in small size group
farmers. On the whole an increase of 34.33 per cent is
observed in production post NFSM programme. There is
positive attitude towards NFSM pulses programme. All ofthe sample farmers are enriched by the demonstration and
training programmes. Distribution of certified seed at 50
per cent subsidy is very beneficial as higher yields arereported by majority of the farmers. Pest problem are also
considerably reduced due to IPM and crop management
practices. Farmers in all size groups have reported increase
in pulses production after NFSM. This growth is even
higher in medium and large size groups.
Constraints in Pulses Development :Pulses crop is mostly given low priority and usuallygrown in rain fed, moisture stress areas and marginal and
sub-marginal lands in terms of soil quality, lack of irrigationetc. Though it is a energy rich crop it is raised in conditions
of energy starvation. Although Tur dal Board recommendsseed replacement every 3 years, farmers continue to use
seeds grown in the farm year after year. Seed management,a crucial element for growth in productivity had witnessed
serious problems in the recent past as it is not improving
seed production. The role of public sector in seed
production is minimal. High fluctuations in prices of pulses
indicating high risk seems to have turned the farmers away
from its cultivation. Low harvest prices continuing up tomarket season is one of the reasons for the low expansionof acreage under pulses cultivation.
Policy Implications :
(1) Technology Access :Every one concedes with the application of latest technical
know-how across fields. In this study it is found that
farmers received information regarding ﬁCertified seed
availability and the pest control practicesﬂ from neighbours
(90 per cent). There is need that the department is to arrange
the sources authentically regarding technology adoption
practices and the reliable access to the farmer community.The farmer community lacks dynamism in practicing the
recommended doses or methods, since they are not well-
versed with the practices recommended. The supply of
equipment in question (sprayers) is to be channelized at
the required and reliable level to reach the farmer in-time
and with out prejudice.
(2) Nutrient Management :It is seen that the good level of yields are realized bythe application of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorous
as expressed by the farmers. This can be supplemented by
Rhizobium culture. But these practices are to be across
fields in sowing season by the extension staff followed by
post-sowing advice and methods to be practiced by the
cultivators.
(3) Marketing Intervention :The government intervention in market is sought atcertain level. During the harvest season, the low price
existence is to be given redress through the cold-storage
arrangement by the department or by permitting the private
to start cold storage at large scale. Furtherprices should reach the farmers, since the middlemen are
sharing the lot of price. The prevailing market price is to be
well known to farmers with the initiation of marketing
department, provided some stipulations are laid against
middlemen to avoid low price fixation in their sales.
(4) Management of Cultivation :As the farmers expressed, the mixed cropping forRed gram is to be followed in other areas. This reduces the
costs of pest control to the farmers. Pest Management in
pulses cultivation is very important and well accepted norm/
practice. The in-time completion of these practices are to
be done and these should be guided by the extension staff.
(5) Distribution/Availability of Inputs :It is observed the scarcity of certified seed acrossthe study district. Therefore, the high amount of certified
seed is to be distributed. Some information brochures/
pamphlets in Telugu regarding the latest input use is to bedistributed to the farmers. The sources of durable and
reliable pesticides are to be informed to the farmers. The
good pesticide brands are to be made available to farmers.
The bulletins or some brochures may be handy to the
farmers regarding input prices or the prices of produce of
the area in question.678Agricultural Situation in IndiaD.  Commodity  Reviews(i)  FoodgrainsDuring the month of February 2012 the WholesalePrices of foodgrains displayed a falling trend. Wholesale
