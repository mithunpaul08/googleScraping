PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN
 INDIAN AGRICULTURE:  
AN ASSESSMENT OF THE POST GREEN REVOLUTION YEARS 
   
1. Introduction  Two successive years of major crop failure in
 the years 1965-66 and 1966-67 resulted in severe 
food shortage all over the country and added urgency to India™s new agricultural development 
strategy. Popularly known as the Green Revolution, the new agricultural policy ushered in an era of modernization in the country™s traditiona
l agriculture that had changed little from the 
Colonial days over the first two decades sin
ce Independence from British rule in 1947. The 
main pillars of the Green Revolution were intr
oduction of high yielding varieties (HYV) of wheat and rice, widespread use of chemical fer
tilizers, introduction of agricultural machinery 
(like tractors and pump sets), extending irriga
tion to a greater area under cultivation thereby 
allowing multiple cropping, and creation of proper 
institutions for agricultural credit. The 
depth of modernization of the production tec
hnology following the Green Revolution can be judged by the increasing role of non-traditional inputs (like power, chemical fertilizers, and 
farm machinery) in Indian agriculture. For instan
ce, use of chemical fertilizers increased from 
2.18 million tonnes in 1970-71 to 16.7 million to
nnes in 2000-01. The number of (wheel and 
crawler) tractors increased 
from 0.1 million in 1970 to 1.94 millions in 2000. Total power 
availability on the farm increased 
from 0.29 kilowatt/hectare in 1971-72 to 1.23 
kilowatt/hectare in 2001-02. Area under mu
ltiple cropping increased from 25.52 million 
hectares in 1970-71 to 43.97 million hectares in
 2001-02. There was a concomitant increase in 
productivity. The index of yield per acre (base: triennium ending 1981-82 = 100) increased 
from 93.2 in 1970-71 to 152.8 in 2000-01 for f
oodgrains. Corresponding change for other crops (non-foodgrain) was from 91.4 in 1970-
71 to 133.2 in 2000-01. Success of the Green 
Revolution is evident from the fact that although deprivation and malnutrition remains an 
endemic problem in rural areas, India has achie
ved self-sufficiency in food and is no longer dependent on imports or outright aid from donor c
ountries to feed its population. In a parallel manner, development of the non-food segment of the 
agricultural sector helps to foster growth of textiles, food processing, and other agro-based manufacturing. Over
all, the extent of  2transformation of Indian agriculture over th
e first three decades following the Green 
Revolution is genuinely impressive. One cannot, however, ignore some disturbing signs that 
the engine of growth driving Indian agriculture is losing its steam. The index of food grains 
production in 2002-03 fell by 18.6% from the level 
reached in the previous year. This was preceded by a 6.66% drop in 2000-01 and followed by a 7.04% drop in 2004-05.  
Every revolution eventually loses momentum
 and the system waits for another major 
breakthrough to sustain the growth process. This may, indeed, be the reality for Indian 
agriculture at this point in time. It is, nevert
heless, important to investigate whether greater 
productivity is achievable within the limits of the prevalent 
technology through elimination of 
technical inefficiencies.  
A firm is said to be weakly effici
ent if it is not possible to increase 
all of its outputs without increasing any input or to reduce all of its inputs without reducing any output. Such weak efficiency does not preclude potential for increasing some outputs or reducing some inputs 
(although not all). Obviously weak efficiency does not ensure Pareto efficiency. Although useful for a summary evaluation of performan
ce, the measured level of weak efficiency 
(whether input- or output-oriented) fails to
 provide a proper benchmark for improvement. In 
order to become fully efficient a firm has to
 eliminate underproduction of every output and at 
the same time avoid under utiliza
tion of every input. Apart from providing a target input-output bundle that the firm should try to attain, Pareto-Koopmans analysis provides input- and output-specific measures of efficiency.  
There are numerous studies in the existing literature that
 measure efficiency in I
ndian agriculture in the recent period. Kalirajan (1981) estimated a profit 
function using data on HYV IR 20 rice production in  
the rabi (winter) season for the year 1977-78, from a progr
essive village in Coimbatore district in the 
Indian state of Tamil Nadu and, following Lau an
d Yotopolus(1971), compared the relative efficiency 
of small and large farms. Kumbhakar and Bhattach
arya (1992) estimated a generalized profit function 
incorporating price distortions resulting from im
perfect market conditions, socio-political and 
institutional constraints alongside technical and allocative inefficiencies using farm level data collected 
by Agro-Economic Research Centre (an organizatio
n for agricultural research under the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Government of India) from the three regi
ons of the Indian State of West Bengal, for the 
year 1980-85. Bhattacharya et al (1996) used farm 
level data for 105 jute growers from West Bengal to 
estimate a generalized indirect production func
tion. Tadesse and Krishnamoorthy (1997) used a 
stochastic frontier production function and estimated 
technical efficiency across seven distinct agro-
 3climatic zone and farm si
ze groups of paddy farms of Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu for the year 
1992-93. Sengupta (2000) used 1989-90 
farm level cost of cultivation data collected by Ministry of 
Agriculture, Government of India,  to obtain alte
rnative measures of efficiency using a non-frontier 
approach.  Shanmugam (2002) estimated technical effi
ciency of rice production in different regions of 
Karnataka, India from 1991-92 to 1994-95, employi
ng the stochastic frontier approach. Mythili and 
Shanmugam  (2000),
 on the other hand, employed stochastic 
frontier methodology using panel data for 
the year 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 to estimate tec
hnical efficiency for the six agro-climatic zones 
in the state Tamil Nadu, India. 

In this paper we use the nonparametric approach 
of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to obtain 
Pareto-Koopmans measures of technica
l efficiency of individual states in India over the years 1970-71 
through 2000-01 in a multi-output, multi-input model of
 agricultural production. Our paper extends the 
extant literature on measurement of efficiency in I
ndian agriculture in several ways. First, although 
there are some applications in other areas
1, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
measuring Pareto-Koopmans efficiency in agricultur
al production. Pareto-Koopmans efficiency is a 
complete measure in the sense that it reflects 
unrealized potential for increasing any output and 
decreasing any input that the firm has failed to expl
oit. In our empirical analysis, we disaggregate the 
overall efficiency measure into two distinct comp
onents representing output and input efficiencies. 
Further, we are able to identify the contributions of
 individual outputs and inputs to the measured level 

of overall efficiency. Second, unlike the previous studies cited above, we examine the entire 

agricultural sector of the country rather than a sa
mple of individual firms from a specific region. 
Moreover, we utilize a panel data set covering th
ree decades following the Green Revolution. This 
enables us to track how different regions of the 
country have performed ove
r this period. Because introduction of modern inputs has been a major com
ponent of the process of modernization of Indian 
agriculture, we examine to what extent states succeeded in utilizing the modern inputs compared to the 

traditional inputs. Finally, we use regression analysis 
to explain variations in efficiency across states in 
terms of difference in various infra-structura
l, institutional, and demographic factors. 
Specifically, we address the following questions:   How do measured levels of technical efficiency as well as individual components vary across 

the different geographical regions (and across states within these regions)? 
 Are there differences in efficiency in the utilization of traditional and non- traditional inputs?  
 How do input and output-oriented efficiencies and their individual components compare across 

years within the sample period?  
                                                 1 Ray and Jeon (2008) measured the Pareto-Koopm
ans efficiency of America™s top-rated MBA 
programs.
  4 What are the possible determinants of inter-state variation in efficiencies? 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 provides an overview of the nonparametric 
methodology. Section 3 describes the data and repor
ts the empirical findings from the efficiency 
analysis. A statistical analysis of the factors explaining the observed variation in technical 
efficiency is presented in section 4. The main c
onclusions and policy implications are summarized 
in section 5.  
2. The Nonparametric Methodology 
2.1 The Technology and Technical Efficiency 
Consider an industry producing bundles of 
m outputs 
y from bundles of 
n inputs 
x. The  production technology is defined by
 the production possibility set  
T ={(x, y): y 
  can be produced from 
x  },                 
(1)    
mRnRAn input-output bundle 
(x0, y0) is feasible if (x0, y0) T.  The bundle 
(x0, y0) is weakly efficient in its 
input-orientation
 if it is not possible to reduce all inputs 
simultaneously without reducing any output. That is,  
                 
 and     (2a)

Similarly, 
(x0, y0) is weakly efficient in its output-orientation
 if 
                     
and    (2b) 
Tyx
),(
00
.),(1

Tyx

That is all outputs cannot be increased simultaneously without increasing any input.  
Note that input-oriented weak efficiency does no
t preclude reduction in one or more (though not all) 
inputs. Similarly, output-oriented weak efficiency is compatible with increase in one or more 

individual outputs. Thus, weak efficiency does not imply Pareto efficiency. Both input- and output-

oriented weak efficiencies are essentially 
radial in nature because one considers radial contraction of 
the input bundle or a radial expansion of the output bundle.  
By contrast, 
(x0, y0) is strongly input-efficient only if a reduction in 
any component of the 
x0 input 
bundle would render the output bundle 
y0 infeasible. That is                             
 and    (3a)

In an analogous manner, 
(x0, y0) is strongly input-efficient only if 
                             
 and    (3b)

Finally,
 is Pareto-Koopmans efficient if both of the following conditions 
simultaneously hold

 5Thus, strong input- and output-efficiency are both necessary and are together sufficient for Pareto-
Koopmans efficiency. 

   
2.2 Data Envelopment Analysis
  In order to calibrate any of the various technical efficiency measures considered above, we need to 

construct the production possibility set empirically 
from observed data. In pa
rametric models, one 
starts with an explicit specification of the produc
tion technology in the form of a production function 
(in the single output case) or a transformation function (in the multiple output case) and uses 
appropriate statistical methods to obtain estimates 
of the parameters of the specified function from 
sample data. By contrast, in the nonparametric a
pproach of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) one 
makes a number of fairly general assumptions a
bout the underlying technology but specifies no 
explicit functional form. Introduced by Charnes,
 Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) (1978) and further 
generalized by Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (
BCC) (1984), DEA allows one to construct the 

production possibility set empirically from observe
d data. Specifically, one makes the following 
assumptions: 
(i) Each input-output bundle 
(xj, yj) (j = 1,2,–,N)
 actually observed in the sample is feasible. 
(ii) The production possibility set 
T is convex. (iii) Inputs are strongly disposable. That is, if

   6Radial Measures of Technical Efficiency
 Following Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984), the i
nput-oriented radial technical efficiency of a 
firm with an observed input-output bundle 
(x0, y0) under the variable returns to scale assumption is 
obtained as:

 Similarly, the output-oriented radial techni
cal efficiency under VRS is measured as

 When CRS is assumed, the restriction 
is deleted from (6) or (7
). It is obvious that neither the input- nor the output-oriented radial measure of tech
nical efficiency is affected 
by the presence (or magnitude) of 
slacks in any of the individual input or output constraints in (6) or (7).
 Nj11Non-Radial Measures of Technical Efficiency 
The problem of slacks in any optimal soluti
on of a radial DEA model arises because 
we seek to expand all outputs or contract all inputs by the same proportion. In non-radial 
models, one allows the individual outputs to increase or the inputs to decrease at different  7rates. Färe and Lovell (1978) introduced the following input-oriented, 
non-radial measure 
of technical efficiency called the Russell measure:

 When input slacks do exist at the optimal soluti
on of a radial DEA model, the non-radial Russell 
measure in (8) falls below the conventional measure
 obtained from an input-oriented BCC model (6). 
Because the radial projection is always a feasible solution for (8), 
.xx
 That is, the non-radial Russell measure of technical efficiency never exceeds the corresponding radial measure. 
The analogous output-oriented non-radial VRS measure of technical efficiency is:
    yyyxRM

While no input slacks can exist at th
e optimal solution of (8), presence 
of any output slack is not ruled 
out. Similarly, input slacks may remain at the optimal solution of (9). Thus, non-radial technical 
efficiency (whether input-oriented or output-oriented) by itself does not ensure over all Pareto 
efficiency. 
  8  
  A non-radial Pareto-Koopmans measure of techni
cal efficiency of the input-output pair 
(x0, y0) can be computed as:

Pastor, Ruiz, and Sirvent (PRS) (1999) and Tone (2001)
 introduced essentially the same measure of overall 
efficiency and called it a slack based measure (SBM). Th
e objective function in (10) is non-linear. Both PRS 
and Tone transformed this linear 
fractional functional programming problem into an LP problem by 
normalizing the denominator to unity. Alternatively, 
as shown in Ray (2004), one may re

function by a linear approximation

We may, therefore, 
replace the objective function in (10) by (11) and solve (10) iteratively using the optimal solution

*r 3. The Empirical Analysis 
 3.1 The Data This study visualizes a two-output and seven-input production technology for Indian agriculture.  
  The two outputs are: (a) food grains and (b) non food grains. The inputs included are: (i) Land, (ii) Fertilizers; (iii) Irrigated Area; (i
v) Pump sets ; (v)Tra
ctors(vi) Electricity; 
and (vii) Labor. Further, the actual amount
 of rainfall is also treated as a non-discretionary input.  Sixteen major Indian States has been considered and are classified 
into four regions:  (A) Eastern Region : Assam (AS), Bihar (BI),
 Orissa (OR), and West Bengal (WB); 
(B) Northern Region: Haryana (HA), Himachal 
Pradesh (HP),Jammu and Kashmir (JK),, 
Punjab (PU) and Uttar Pradesh (UP); 
 10(C) Southern Region: Andhra Pradesh (AP), Karnataka (KA), Kerala (KE), and            Tamil Nadu (TN);  
(D) Western  Region
 : Gujarat (GU), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Maharashtra (MH), and          Rajasthan (RA). Data used in this study have been collected from the different issues of

ll productive efficiency and its two principal components, input and output e
fficiencies, are presented in Ta
ble 1. More detailed breakup of the input and output efficiencies are reported in Tables 2.1-2.3. Overall productive efficiency and its components 
The overall productive efficiency and its compone
nts are presented in Table1. At the All-India level the level of output technical efficiency ((OTE), averaged over all years and all states, was 
0.8549 implying that on average output was about 85.5%
 of the Pareto optimal level. Similarly, 
the level of input-oriented technical efficiency was 0.8603. That is, about 14% reduction in the average level of inputs would be possible. The overall level of Pareto Koopmans (PK) 
efficiency was 75.45%. Among the individual states
, Uttar Pradesh (UP) showed the highest 
level of Pareto-Koopmans efficiency; West Be
ngal (WB) was a close second. Both states 
achieved overall efficiency above 96%.  Three other states, Tamil Nadu (TN), Punjab (PU), 
and Assam (AS) were more than 90% efficient.
  At the other extreme, Gujarat (GU), and 
Jammu & Kashmir (JK) had efficiency below 
50%; Kerala (KE) and Rajasthan (RA) were slightly above 50%. At the regional level, the Eastern region performed the best and the 
Western Region did the worst. In view of this, a nearly 90% overall efficiency of Maharashtra (MH), a Western state was quite remarkable. 

  11Overall input efficiency varied from a high 
of 0.975 for West-Bengal (W
B) to a low of 0.693 for the state Kerala (KE). The all-India average was 0.858.   At the regional level, the overall input efficiency is highest in the Eastern region (0.918), follo
wed by the Northern region (0.886). By contrast, Western region (0.829) and lowest in the Southern region (0.803) 
performed much worse. At the st
ate level, input efficiency was the highest in Uttar Pradesh 
(UP) and West Bengal (WB) exceeding 97% in both cases. Punjab (PU), Assam (AS)Tamil 
Nadu (TN), and Maharashtra (MH)  all had input efficiency above 90%. Surprisingly, 
however, so did two other states Œ Bihar (BI) and Madhya Pradesh (M) Œ even though their overall Pareto efficiency scores were quite low.  Average output technical efficiency (OTE) was slightly below the input technical efficiency (ITE). This comparison hides the f
act that for most states, output 
efficiency was higher than the input efficiency. In Madhya Pradesh (MP) output efficiency was only 75.6% whereas input efficiency was 91.5%. Similarly, 
in Rajasthan (RA) output efficiency was 62.8% while input 
efficiency was 81.2% In Bihar (BI) and Jammu & Kashmir (JK) output efficiency was lower 
than input efficiency by over 8 percentage points. Despite these individual cases most Indian 
states performed better in resp
ect of realizing the potential 
outputs than in conserving the surplus inputs. 
Input Efficiency  Tables 2.1 and 2.2 provide more de
tails on the on the components 
of input technical efficiency. As noted at the beginning, introduction of modern
 inputs was an integral part of the new agricultural strategy in the Green 
Revolution era. In light of this, we divided the agricultural inputs into two broad categories: modern and traditional. Include
d in the modern category are: (i) fertilizers, (ii) pumps, (iii) tractors, and (iv)
 (electric) power. The other inputs: (a) labor, (b) irrigation, and (c) land are treated as traditional i
nputs. Use of chemical 
fertilizers, pumps for 
deep well irrigation, tractors and tillers, and electric power are the hallmarks of the new 
technology. Of course, there is some measure of 
overlap in the sense that irrigation in the traditional category relies on deep wells as the sour
ce and, hence, to a considerable extent, is 
closely related to pumps (and power). As can be
 seen from Tables 2.1 and 2.2, while utilization 
of the traditional inputs was reasonably high, the modern inputs were considerably under-

utilized. At the All-India level, the average rate of under-utilization of modern inputs was 
 1220.7% Given that these non-traditional inputs account for a large part of the paid out costs in 
farming, this is quite disturbing. 

For any individual input, the input-specific technical efficiency of any particular state (reported in Table 2.1) shows what proportion of the actual quantity of that input used would be required if the state operated at 
the selected Pareto-Koopmans effici
ent point on the frontier. Only 5 states, Bihar (BI), West Bengal (WB), Punjab 
(PU), Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Tamil Nadu (TN), 
had average input efficiency over 90% for the modern inputs. The All-India average was even lower than 80% implying that over a fifth of the actual input bundle was being wasted. At the 

individual input level, efficiency was lowest for power (73.76%). For fertilizer, it was still 
below 80%.  The strikingly low numbers for Gujarat (GU) may have been due to some data 
problem (although data errors over 
all inputs and all years appear to be highly unlikely). But even when we exclude Gujarat, the average improved only marginally. In the case of 

fertilizers, Jammu & Kashmir (JK), Kerala (KE), Gujarat (GU) had efficiency below 45% 

while Karnataka (KA) was at the 53% level. For pumps, Gujarat 
had efficiency below 40% and 
Kerala (KE) barely exceeded 50%. But most ot
her states were quite efficient. For tractors, 
Jammu & Kashmir (JK), Karnatak
a (KA), Kerala (KE), and Gujarat (GU) performed poorly. 
Others were fairly to highly efficient. In 
the case of power, Jammu & Kashmir (JK), Karnataka 
(KA), Kerala (KE), and Gujarat (GU) had very low efficiency. Orissa (OR) and Andhra Pradesh (AP) also had over 35% under-utilization of the power input. Region-wise, the Southern states had efficiency below 65% for fertilizer and power. Tamil Nadu (TN) was an 
exception. Western states had efficiency barely above 
65% in case of power. Low efficiency 
rating of the Western region is ma
inly driven by Gujarat (GU).  Low input specific efficiencies in respect of th
e modern inputs contrast sharply with traditional 
inputs where except for Bihar (BI) in respect of labor and Jammu & Kashmir (JK) in respect of 
irrigation, input efficiencies are uniformly high. It would be
 worthwhile to examine if 
government subsidization of fertilizer and power
 inputs account for avoidable waste in these inputs found in Table 2.1. Output Efficiency 
Table 2.3 shows the decomposition of the overall 
output efficiency into separate components 
for food grains and other ((non-food grain) crops. For food grains, output efficiency is above 90% for all states other than Kerala (KE), and Gujarat (GU). By comparison efficiency in the 
 13production of other crops is much lower. Ja
mmu & Kashmir (JK) (25.27%), Gujarat (GU) 
(56.89%). Andhra Pradesh (AP) (62.48%) and Bihar (BI) (65.73%) are the most inefficient 
states in this respect. 
While a high average level of output efficiency in respect of food grai
ns is good news, it also carries an implicit warning that there is not mu
ch room for increasing food supply within the 
present technological frontier. In view of the increasing level of commercialization of 
agriculture in India, the poor performance observed in respec
t of the other crops is somewhat 
puzzling. It is possible that because most of 
these products (like cotton and jute fiber) are produced as industrial raw material
s, demand fluctuation in the relevant industries may restrict 
production well below the full potential. This, of course, is only a speculation that can be 
verified only with crop specific data. That is beyond the scope of the present study.   Efficiency over time 
Another question that we addre
ss in this study is whether there is any clear pattern in how 
input or output specific efficiency levels have changed over time. The findings in this respect 
are reported in Table 3. To eliminate the random noi
se often found in year-to-year variations in 
efficiency, we focus, instead, on average levels of
 efficiency over 5-year periods. In the first 
half of the 1970s, both input and output efficiencies were quite high. Further. The rate of utilization of modern inputs exceeded 91%. On
 the output side, both food grains and other crops showed high efficiency. One may argue that the Green Revol
ution got off to a good start. During the latter half of the 70s, even though efficiency with respect to modern inputs on the 
one hand and non-food crop output on the other showed a slight decline, overall input and output efficiencies  both remained above 90%. The 
next decade saw a drastic drop in efficiency with respect to modern inputs as well as non
-food output. Both of them were between 72% and 74%. Particularly low were the utilization rates of fertilizer and power inputs. During the first half of the 1990s, there was some improvement
 in respect of mode
rn inputs overall but efficiency in the utilization of power remain
ed below 70%. Over the last half of the 1990s, 
things worsened. Quite low efficiency is found for tractors and power. For the first time, output 
efficiency fell below 90% for food grains. All in all, there is a decline in input and output efficiencies over time. This is
 particularly noticeable for non-food crops and for some modern 
inputs (especially, fertilizers and power).   14 4. Explaining the variation Pareto- Koopmans Efficiency   
 Modernization of traditional agriculture involves numerous structural
 changes at different levels. The most important of them is repla
cement of  age old farming parctices by a more 
advanced and knowledge based technology. As noted by Dantwala (1967, 1970), there are 
other concomittant changes like commericialization of a predominantly subsistence agriculture 

through integration of an isolated village based economy into a national and eventual global 
economy and breaking up rural monopolies in la
nd though a more eaglatarian distribution.    
In the post-Green Revolution era, the newly introduced high yielding variety seeds and chemicial fertilizers have greatly enhanced th
e importance of assured supply of water through deep well and canal irrigation. Although government and private irrigarion have 
complimentary roles to play, commodification of
 water as a purchased input supplied from 
private sources has played a major role
 (as in the case of  winter rice, 
Boro, in West Bengal). 
Other kinds of physical infrastructures (like road and rail communication facilities, telephones, 
network of power lines in rural areas, etc) also enhance productive efficiency. 
Government expenditure on agri
cultural education, research, a
nd extension contributes to human capital formation and fac
ilitates transtion from traditional to modern technology. Eeven 
the spread of basic education (raising the rural literacy rate) 
contributes towards increase in human capital. Because of the growing importa
nce of purcahsed inputs, easy and timely 
availability of agriocultural credit is also conducive to increasing efficiency.  
It is well known that trade liber
alization provides many benefits
 such as increase in market 
size, knowledge of demand characteristics in foreign markets, information about new 

technologies, process and products and cost reductions and quality improvements. Also the 
gains from trade can arise because of (a) moveme
nts to existing production possibility frontiers 
(due to technical efficiency), (b) movement along the existing frontiers because of new trading 
opportunities and (c) upward shift of the frontier (due to learning, application of improved 
technologies and adoption of better farming pract
ices. As explained below, a state with a higher (weighted) share of its agricultural products in the country™s exports benefits more from 
liberalized trade policies. 
 15At the individual producer level, crop diversification makes the farmer more competitive 
allowing it to access the market for a greater 
number of products. Further, diversification 
lowers risk and fosters commercialization allowing the farmer to step outside the bounds of 
what once was described as the ﬁsurvival algorithmﬂ when producing enough food crop for 
subsistence was the highest priority. 
Finally, land reforms and loweri
ng the concentration of ownership is a well documented engine 
of productivity and efficiency growth in agriculture. There are several individual country studies that explore the possible connection of land distribution and productivity. Besley and Burgess (2000) finds that land reforms had their 
greatest effect in those Indian states with 
greatest initial land inequality. Jeon and Kim (2000) documen
t significant productivity gains from land reforms undertaken in Korea in the 
1950s  which limited the amount of land any 
individual can own. Banerjee and  Iyer (2005) examining the histor
ical nature of land distribution in India find that those Indian states with higher initial land inequality had lower 
productivity even after land reform took place. 
Vollarth (2007) addresses the issue of land 
distribution and international agricultural productivity by using cross country data on inequality in operational holding of agricultural land reform from Deininger and Squire 
(1998).In an estimation of an agricultural pr
oduction function , the Gini coefficient for land holdings is found to have a significant negative relationship with productivity. In view of the above, we specified a log-linear regression with the Pareto-Koopmans efficiency 
(PK) as the dependent variable and (a) Gini ratio of land distribution (GINI), (b) degree of openness (OPEN), (c) government spending on agri
cultural education and 
research (EDUR),  
(d) acreage under private irrigation (PI), (e) acreage under government (canal) irrigation (GI),  
(f) availability of agricultural credit (LOAN), (g) crop diversifi
cation index (CDI),  (h) rural literacy rate (RLR), and a physical infrastructure index (INFR)  as explanatory variables. Each state in the sample was treated as a unit of observation. 
Data construction was carried out as follows. 
 The Gini ratio was constructed from the Census of agriculture.   Degree of openness was constructed in the following way. Let the country export  
R  number of agricultural goods and net export of each commodities be E
1, E2 ––..ER .Let E be the net export of the country. Then m1 = E1/E, m2 = E2/E,..,mR = ER/E, be the share of each commodities in total net export basket. Suppose that 
 16there are j = 1, 2 –.. n number of
 states in the country and sij, i = 1, 2 –.. R, j = 1, 2 –. n is the value share of crop i in total agricultural production of state j. Then the index of openness for the state j can be constructed  as                   1122

R The amount of Government expenditure 
on agricultural education and research is normalized by dividing it total ar
ea under agricultural operation and is denoted as EDUR. 
 Private and government irrigation is m
easured by the proportion of irrigated  area under the two kinds of irrigation.  Agricultural credit (LOAN) is measured
 by the total amount of credit issued by 
rural banks and agricultural cooperatives pe
r acre of cultivated area in the state. 
 Crop diversification index (CDI) is the Hirshmann-Harfindahl index of 
diversification of land allocated to different crops.  Rural Literacy Rate comes from the Census.

De   using Principal Component Analysis (1998). The preferred estimated model is 
reported in the following table:

gree of openness and government expenditure on 
agricultural research and extension, have t-values than 2.0 and are significant at 6 % and 7 % level of significance respectiv
ely. Both of them have positive impact on efficiency. GINI
  17Coefficient is significant at 11% level of significance and has the anticipated negative sign. A higher concentration of land ownership lowers 
efficiency. Rural literacy rate has a positive 
coefficient that is significant at the 17.5% level.. The other explanatory variables are significant between 22% to 27% levels of significance. Private irrigati
on has a greater impact 
on efficiency than government irrigation. All of th
e coefficients have ‚t™ ratios well in excess of unity. The R2 of the model is a moderate 47.8%.  
We may now summarize the main findi
ngs from the empirical analysis: 
 There is strong evidence of an overall decline in both input- and output efficiencies over time. It is particularly true of the modern inputs and non food crops. Thus, 
although the use of fertilizers, agricultural machinery, and power has increased 
phenomenally over years, rates of produc
tive utilization of the inputs has fallen. Because use of these modern inputs is an
 integral part of the modern technology, 
potential benefits of the technological change remain unr
ealized to a considerable extent. 
 There is little room for incr
easing food production simply through improved efficiency. 
Relatively high rates of utilization of traditional inputs (especially land and irrigation) suggest that these are the inputs that could limit increas
ing output without another technological breakthrough.  There is considerable inter-regional variation in the levels of input- and output-specific efficiencies. This is particularly true for modern inputs and non-food output. The 
Eastern Region performs the best in terms of both input and output efficiency. Further, 

the average input and output efficiencies are approximately equal in this region. This is 
true of the Northern Region also, which al
so shows high average efficiency. The other 

two regions, Western states have a higher i
nput efficiency while the Southern states 
have a higher average level of output efficiency.  Although fertilizers and power are the two inputs that largel
y account for the low levels of efficiency (i.e., utilization) of modern inputs, there is
 considerable variation across regions (and states within regions). For the Eastern Region, efficiency is highest for tractors and for the other three modern inputs 
it is about equal. In the Northern Region, efficiency is highest for pumps and about 
equal for the other three inputs. In the 
 18Southern Region, efficiency is lower for fertilizers and power. Finally, in the Western 
Region, efficiency is highest for fertilizers and lowest for power. Based on the regression analysis reported above, the following policy recommendations for 
improving overall technical efficiency can be made: 
 The government should increase expend
iture on agricultural education and research. 
 Trade liberalization policy should be aggressively pursued.  The government should carry out land reform 
in order to lower the inequality in land ownership.  Policies to raise the literacy rate among the rura
l population will increase 
efficiency. 
 Private irrigation schemes should be supported and encouraged through appropriate incentives. Public irrigation projects shoul
d be viewed as complementary to rather 
than substitutes for private irrigation. 
 Crop diversification should be encouraged through agricultural extension programs 
as well as easier access to credit. 
It is advisable to recognize, at this point, some limitations of 
the data used and to acknowledge that the results should be inte
rpreted with some caution. In the first place, we are using highly 
aggregated data. Not only are the 
input-output data aggregates over all farms in a state, they are 
also aggregated over crops and, hence, across di
fferent varieties of any crop (like traditional 
and high yielding varieties of rice or wheat). Similarly, inputs 
(like fertilizers) are also aggregated. Despite this limitation, our 2-output 
multi-input framework is more disaggregated 
than what is found in the relevant literature.  Another important point to rememb
er is that state level efficiency measures computed for each 
year are based on the input-output data for that particular year only. In the jargon of Data Envelopment Analysis, these ar
e efficiencies relative to a contemporaneous frontier. No attempt is made to measure efficiency agains
t ﬁcross-period frontiersﬂ. This circumvents the 
question of technical progress. Finally, although we have efficiency measures by state and 
year, similar year- and state-wise information a
bout the explanatory variables is not available. This ruled out a (2-way fixed effects) panel regression. We had to settle, instead, for a 

regression using the mean of the de
pendent and independent variables.  19In spite of these limitations, evidence of the 
downward movement in overall efficiency as well 
as in output and input efficiencies is quite convincing.  5. Conclusion  It is well known from the general theory of diffusion of both ideas and products that there are four distinct stages in the process. The new idea is first embraced by innovators, the small 
percentage of the relevant population who dare to try some
thing new. Then come the 
early adopters, the more careful segment who prefer 
to wait-and-see first. Next are the 
late adopters, who are mainly driven by the exam
ple of others. Finally enter the laggards. In the case of the Green Revolution, it is reasonable to argue that the more productive farmers with greater 
human capital came first. Over time, the less 
productive ones followed. This is a reasonable explanation of the decline in efficiency (especially for modern inputs and cash crops) over 
time. In any event, it seems to be the case that Indian agriculture is likely to remain stagnant 

unless a new breakthrough in the technology takes place.
