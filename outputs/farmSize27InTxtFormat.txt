30   3 Role of Infrastructure 
in Productivity and  
Diversification of Agriculture 
  1. Introduction  
Efficiency and competitiveness needs to be the cornerstone in any agricultural 
development strategy in the liberalized economic environment. This question is 
particularly relevant to the small farmer
s in developing countries where size of 
holdings are very small and traditional crops with low productivity are not capable of 
providing sufficient income and employment to the population dependent on 
agriculture sector.  In the State of Tamil Nadu, 74 per cent of the holdings are below 

one hectare in size and nearly 90 per cent 
of them are below 2 hectares. Productivity 
is decelerating for most of the crops in 90s at low levels of average productivity 
compared to world average. Securing the livelihood security for this large number of 
farmers involve increasing the productiv
ity and diversification of crops.  
Significant 
increases in investment in rural infrastructure would help increase production and 
consumption, decrease malnutrition, and increase livelihood security.
   In the 
emerging global order, farmers need to invest, innovate and take risks for increasing 
productivity in small farms in the developing countries. For which, assured market for 
produces and easy access to input mark
et is a precondition. Poor transport 
infrastructure limits market access for many farmers in the developing countries. 
Producers need to be better linked to mark
ets through investment in infrastructure 
aimed at reducing transport and marketing costs to realize the market potential.  But 

public investment in agriculture has been declining in real terms in the 90s. 
Institutional rigidities and infra
structural deficiencies need to be addressed to make 
the agriculture competitive. But the survey of literature clearly demonstrates there are 
limited studies on the role of infrastructure in enabling agriculture to respond the 
challenges of globalization. Most of the st
udies consider only road and irrigation in 
rural infrastructure, leaving other important 
productivity enabling infrastructure. This 
study besides irrigation and road also take
s into account input and output markets and 
commercial vehicles as infrastructural variable. Earlier studies on agricultural 
productivity and infrastructure considered output growth while in the present study 
 4productivity is analyzed through Total Factor
 Productivity (TFP). TFP is conceptually 
superior measure to study the contribution of infrastructural variables, as it explains 
the growth in output which is not explained by the growth in the traditional 
production inputs.  
 2. Survey of Literature 
 
Research in Asia found that in villages with better access to roads, fertilizer costs 
were 14 percent lower, wages were 12 percent higher and crop output was 32 percent 
higher (IFPRI,1990). In Africa, rural road construction has been found to be 
associated with increases in agricultural production, especially in non-food export 

crops, expanded use of agricult
ural credit, increases in land values, proliferation of 
small shops and expansion of rural ma
rkets (Anderson et al., 1982). Numerous 
sources of such ﬁhorizontalﬂ impacts of 
policy reform can be found in developing 
country settings. For example, geographic disparities in access to human and physical 
infrastructure affect prospects for particip
ating in the opportunities created by greater 
openness to external trade (Ravallion, 2004). Infrastructure helps poorer individuals 
and underdeveloped areas to get connected to
 core economic activities, thus allowing 
them to access additional productive opport
unities (Estache, 2003). Similarly, 
infrastructure development in poorer regions reduces production and transaction costs 
(Gannon and Liu, 1997).  For example, in poor
 rural areas infrastructure expands job 
opportunities for the less advantaged by reducing the costs to access product and 
factor markets (Smith et al. 2001). The fixe
d transaction costs (those not dependent on
 commercialized volume) of subsistence 
farmers™ to access product markets are 
equivalent to a value-added tax of approxima
tely 15 percent, illustrating the potential 
for raising producer welfare with effective infrastructure investments. (Renkow, 
Hallstrom, and Karanja, 2004)
.  Estache and Fay (1995) found that enhanced access to 
roads and sanitation has been a key determinant of income convergence for the 

poorest regions in Argentina and Brazil. Infrastructure access can raise the value of 
the assets of the poor. Improvements in communication and road services imply 
capital gains for these poor farmers (Jacoby, 2000). Some research studies consider 
the issue of infrastructure efficiency. Hulten (1996) finds that differences in the 
effective use of infrastructure resources expl
ain one-quarter of the growth differential 
between Africa and East Asia, and more than 40 percent of the growth differential 
 5between low- and high-growth countries. Esfahani and Ramirez (2002) report 
significant growth effects of infrastructure in a large panel data set in which the 
contribution of infrastructure is affected 
by institutional factors. Ferreira (1995) 
presents a model of public-private capital
 complementarity in which expanding public 
investment reduces inequality. Another strand of recent literature analyzes the role of 
infrastructure on income inequality. Infrastructure development can have a positive 

impact on the income and welfare of the poor over and above its impact on average 
income (Lopez 2004).  César Calderón (2004) found that inequality declines not only 
with larger infrastructure stocks but also with an improved quality of infrastructure 
services regardless of the econometric technique and the inequality measure employed 
(Gini coefficients or income shares). The links between infrastructure services and 

inequality were also discussed by Estach
e, Foster and Wodon (2002), Estache (2003) 
and World Bank (2003).  
 The present study aims at answering the research questions such as (1) what is the 
role of infrastructure in agricultural productivity? (2) To what extent infrastructure 
development in public sector affects efficien
cy and diversification in crop production? 
(3) Whether infrastructure has differential 
impact on profitability of agriculture 
among different size groups of farmers? A
nd (4) what kind of relationship exists 
between public and private investment in agricultural infrastructure? The specific 
objectives of the study are:   
 3. Objectives of the study

agriculture, 
 ii. To analyze the role of infrastructure in
 crop diversification and efficiency of 
crop production,  
 iii.

investment; and 
 iv.
 To identify the constraints in fostering public investments in agriculture and 
suggest policies to augment them 
  64. Methodology 
 a. Infrastructure and productivity  
 Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is defined as growth in output which is not 
explained by input growth but a combined result of technical progress and 

technical efficiency or the efficiency with which factors are used, given the 
technical progress, to produce output (Fan, 1991). It is a conceptually superior 
measure to gain richer insights into the 
sources and efficiency of agricultural 
production growth. For example, Fan and Hazell (2000) modeled agricultural output 
as a function of traditional farm inputs, technology, infrastructure and time. The 

significant and positive time trend in the model suggested the existence of important 
but missing technology and infrastructure variables in the model. These may include 
the impacts of agricultural research not captured by the High Yielding Varieties 
variable (eg research on improved husbandry 
practices), agricultural extension and so 
on. TFP captures all such variables as it is defined as growth in output which is not 
explained by the growth in input. TFP indices are constructed to compare 
performance of a given system at two points 
in time (inter-temporal TFP indices) or to 
compare two systems at a given point in time (interspatial TFP indices). If the ratio of 

total outputs to total inputs is increasing, then the ratio can be interpreted to measure 
that more outputs can be obtained for a gi
ven input level. Differences in TFP over 
time or across farming types can result from several factors (Ahearn et al. 1998), such 
as: (i) differences in efficiency (less than the maximum output is produced from a 

given input bundle), (ii) variation in scale 
or level of production over time, as the 
output per unit of input varies with the scal
e of production or (iii), technical change. 
TFP is achieved over time on account of the farmer™s rationality in resource use and 
as a follow up of the economic policies and environment (Kaur and Sekhon, 2005) 
and infrastructure like markets, roads and vehicles not only aids in making such 

rational choices but also in achieving them. Surprisingly, one rather neglected 
determinant of productivity growth is public infrastructure (Mamatzakis, 2003) 
even though agriculture is an economic activity in which the role of public 
infrastructure is particularly influential. Public infrastructure is one of the productive 
inputs for Greek agriculture (Fousekis and Pantzios, 2000) and it is positively 

correlated with the Total F
actor Productivity of Greek agriculture (Mamatzakis, 
 72003). Aschauer (1989) finds that the stock of public infrastructure capital is a 
significant determinant of aggregate TFP. 
 TFP is the ratio of aggregate outputs to aggregate inputs used in the agricultural 
production process. Total output and total input are measured in an index form. A 
Torngvist-Theil index is used to aggregate both inputs and outputs. The major problem 

with the index number approach lies in de
riving aggregate output and input measures 
that represents the numerous outputs 
and inputs involved in most production 
processes. The most popular indexing procedure is the Divisia index. As Richter 
(1966) has shown, the Divisia index is desirable because of its invariance property: if 
nothing real has changed (for example, i f the only input quantity changes involve 

movements along an unchanged isoquant), then the index itself is unchanged (Alston, 
Norton, and Pardey 1998). The formula for the index of aggregate production is 
 In YI
t = i 1/2(S 
i,t
 + S 
i, t-1
) ln(Y i,t /Y 
i, t-1)  -1  
 where In YI
t, is the log of the production index at time
.t, S
i,t and S
i, t-1
, I are output i's 
share in total production value at time t and t-1, respectively, and Y
i,t and Y
 i, t-1
, are 
quantities of output i at time t and t-1, respectively. Farm prices are used to calculate the 

weights of each crop in the value of total production. Five cereal crops (rice, jowar, 
bajra, ragi, and maize), 2 pulse crops (black gram and green gram), 4 vegetable crops ( 
onion, brinjal, lady™s finger and tomato), 2 
oil seed crops ( groundnut and gingelly) and 4 
commercial crops ( Cotton, sugarcane, turmeric and chillies) were included in this measure 

of total production. The formula for the index of aggregate input is: 
 In XI
t =  i 1/2(W i,t + W i, t-1
) ln(X 
i,t
 /X 
i, t-1
) -2 
 Wi,t  and W
i, t-1 
are cost shares of input i in total cost at time t and t-1, 
respectively; and X
i,t  and X
 i, t-1
 are quantities of input i at time t and t-I, 
respectively. Five inputs (labor, land, fertilizer, machine labour, and pesticides) are 
included.  
 Labor input is measured as the total number of hours of male and female labor 

employed in agriculture at the end of each year; land is measured as gross 
 8cropped area; fertilizer input as the total amount of nitrogen, phosphate, and 
potassium used; machine labor is measured in number of hours. The wage 
rate for agricultural labor is used as the price of labor to aggregate total cost for 
labor, the costs of machine labor, plant prot
ection chemicals are taken directly from 
the production cost surveys, and the fertilizer cost is the product of total fertilizer 
use and fertilizer price calculated as a weighted average of the prices of 

nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium. The land cost is measured as the residual of total 
revenue net of measured costs for labor, fertilizer, machine labor and plant 
protection chemicals. Therefore, the cost share of each input is calculated by 
its respective cost divided by total production cost. 
 Total factor productivity (TFP) is defined as aggregate output minus aggregate inputs.  
 ln TFPt = 
i 1/2(S 
i,t
 + S i, t-1
) ln(Y i,t
 /Y i, t-1) -  i 1/2(W i,t + W 
i, t-1
) ln(X 
i,t /X 
i, t-1
) -3 
 Where ln TFP, is the log of the TFP index  
 The following model is proposed to identify the factors contributing the TFP growth 
in agriculture. This model include infrastructure variable like irrigation, road density, 

research institutes, markets and other 
production related variables like Area under 
High Yielding Varieties and rainfall. All the variables in the model are in logarithm.

 Variables used in the above model are discussed below. 
1. Irrigation intensity 
Irrigation intensity is the ratio 
of gross irrigated area to ne
t irrigated area. Most of the 
irrigation infrastructure is created through public investment. 
 2. Road density 

Road density is the ratio of total road length to the geographical area of the district. 
The road density augments the location advantage of farms with respect to transport 
of input and output and access to markets. World Development Report (2005) argues 
Roads and commercial vehicles increase 
the choices of farmers not only in the 
selection of better and appropriate inputs
 but the selection of efficient product 
markets also. Roads allow farmers to move their goods more often and more cheaply. 
In some cases the time it took to get to rural markets fell by half. In the areas 

benefiting from the road upgrading, the land is more productive, and the volume and 
value of agricultural produce is higher. As
 it became easier to ship produce quickly 
without damaging it, farmers shifted from low-value cereals to high-value fruit. As 
the price of bringing goods to the farms fell, farmers used more fertilizer. 

 
3. Input and Output markets 
The number of dealers of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds are includes in input 

markets. Output markets include the number of rural shandies, farmers™ markets, 
regulated markets, co operative marketing societies. 

 
4. Commercial vehicles 
The bulkiness of the agricultural outputs and inputs is an inherent characteristic which 

limits the access to efficient markets. The easy access and cheap transport overcome 
this limitation in achieving efficiency and increasing the total factor productivity. 

  105. Pump set  
Ratio total pump set to the cropped area of the district indirectly measure the 

electricity consumption, an important infrastructural variable in agricultural 
production. 
 6 High Yielding Varieties 
High yielding varieties represent technolog
ical improvement and contribute for total 
factor productivity in agriculture. 
 
7. Rain fall  
Rain fall has significant influence on crop 
growth and agricultural productivity and 
hypothesized to have major influence on total factor productivity. 
 8. Rural literacy rate  
Education of the farmer plays vital role in efficiency in production, e.g., a better 
educated farmer will do better in growing a crop than the less educated farmer 
growing the same crop. 
 b. Infrastructure and Diversification 
 There is a strong evidence that it is not the farm size, but infrastructure like access to 

motorable road, market and irrigation which determine the extent, success and 
profitability of diversifica
tion through high paying crops 
like off-season vegetables 
(Chand 1995). Timmer (1997) stylizes the contrast between the diversification of 
national food production and that of farm-level production for Asian agriculture. He 
speculates that, as agricultural transformation continues further, the diversification 
level of national production might go up again because improved 
commercialization of agricu
lture allows ecologically diverse regions to pursue 
their comparative advantage. But the diversification level at the farm level is likely 
to go down, since the principle of comparative advantage continues to work, 
driving each farm to specialize in the activity it can perform the best. But some 
studies report mixed effects of infrastructural variables on crop diversity. A study in 
Ethiopia finds households farther away from an all-weather road grow more 

diverse barley and maize, but less diverse teff. Households in communities located 
 11farther away from the district town have less diverse maize (Benin et al, 2004). 
Similarly another study in West Punjab reports opposite influence of irrigation and 
road density on crop diversity in two periods. In general, irrigation development 
makes it technically feasible to grow diverse crops. During the colonial period, 
when large-scale irrigation was first introduced, crop shifts to high value-added 
crops implied a more diversified cropping pattern, thereby contributing to an 

increase in the diversification index. In contrast, after the early 1950s, when large-
scale canal irrigation was becoming an obsolete technology, further shifts to high 
value-added crops in highly irrigated districts implied more specialization. The 
coefficient on road density also takes opposite signs-districts with better road net-
works are associated with moderately positive trends before 1952, whereas they are 

associated with substantially negative trends after 1952. The strongly negative 
effect in the second period seems to suggest that the road infrastructure helps 
specialization in agriculture when specialization occurs all over the districts. We can 
interpret this as the effect of reduced transportation costs in narrowing the gap 
between the market price of a commodit
y and its farm-gate price. The positive 
effect in the first period (although its significance level is only marginal) seems to 
suggest that the initial development of roads occurred only locally so that its impact 
on district-level specialization was weak (Kurosaki, 2003). The significance of crop 

shifts in the process of agricultural transformation can be understood through the 
development of rural markets. If all producers choose crops on the principle of 
comparative advantage, and all producers face the same relative prices land 
reallocation occurs only when technology or relative prices change. In 

agriculture, however, the assumption that all producers face the same relative 
prices is not justifiable because spatial dimensions and transportation costs are 
important in crop production (Takayama and Judge, 1971; Baulch, 1997).  
 Specialization or diversification is measured through indices like Herfindal index, 

Simpson index and Entropy index (Kelly Ryan and Patel 1995, Pandey and Sharma 
1996, Chand 1996). Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) would be used to capture the 
diversification of agriculture as it pr
ovides a clear dispersion of crops in a 
geographical area. The following model is specified with all the variables in 
logarithm. 

  12SID =

  c. Infrastructure and Efficiency in production 
 The efficiency in agricultural production for major crops will be studied under 

different infrastructural endowments. Primar
y data on agricultural production will be 
collected from 60 farmers each from two districts Viz., with highest and lowest 

infrastructural endowment.  

 
i. Infrastructure Index 
 An infrastructure index was constructed to identify the districts with high and low 

infrastructure. Adopting the methodology of Iyengar and Sudarshan (1982) an 
Infrastructure index was constructed.  Let X
id represent   i
th infrastructure in d th 
district. Yid  = (Xid Œ 
Min Xid ) / (Max X
id - Min X
id )  -6 
 13Where Min  X
id  and Max X
id  are respectively, the minimum and maximum of X
i1, Xi2, –.. X
in.  
The scaled values, Y
id vary from 0 to 1. Accordingly, Namakkal and 
Ramanathapuram districts were selected to represent high and low infrastructural 
endowed districts respectively.  
 ii. Technical Efficiency in agricultur
al production: Stochastic Production 
Frontier Estimation  Since Farrell (1957) seminar paper, there has been a growing body of literature in the 
methodology and their applications to efficiency measurement. While early 
methodologies were based on deterministic models that attribute all deviations 

from the maximum production to efficiency, recent advances have made it possible 
to separately account for factors beyond and within the control of firms such that 
only the latter will cause inefficiency. Aigner et al. (1977), Meeusen and Van Den 
Broeck (1977) independently proposed the stochastic frontier production function 
with two independent error components. 
The one accounts for the presence of 
technical inefficiencies in
 production and the other accounts for measurement 
errors in output, weather, etc and the combined effects of unobserved inputs in 
production. This methodology was used in number of studies to measure the technical 

efficiency (Tzouvelekas et al..2001, Wadud and White 2000, Sharma et al., 1999, 
Battese and Coelli 1995). Using a two-stage procedure, the predicted efficiency 
indices were regressed against a number of household/farm characteristics, in an 
attempt to explain the observed differences in efficiency among farms (Nkamleu, 

2004; Nyemeck et al., 2003; Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro, 1997). Although this 
exercise has been recognized as a useful on
e,  the two-stage estimation procedure is 
inconsistent in its assumptions regarding the independence of the inefficiency effects 
in the two estimation stages.  The two-stage estimation procedure is unlikely to 
provide estimates which are as efficient as 
those that could be obtained using a single-
stage estimation procedure. Coelli (1996) and Battese and Coelli (1995) extended the 
stochastic production frontier model by suggesting that the inefficiency effects can be 
expressed as a linear function of explanatory variables, reflecting farm specific 
characteristics. The advantage of Battese and Coelli (1995) model is that it allows 
estimation of the farm specific efficiency scores and the factors explaining 

efficiency differentials among farmers in a single stage estimation procedure 
 14(Rahman, 2003). In this study the general stochastic pr
oduction function (Battese and 
Coelli, 1993, 1995), with inefficiency effects is defined as: 
 yi = f (x
i; ) exp(vi - ui)             i = 1,...,n                 (1)           
 where 
yi denotes the output quantity of the 
ith farm, 
xi 
is a (1 x 
J) vector of input 
quantities and 
 is a (
J x 1) vector of unknown parameters to be estimated. The 
vi 
are 
two-sided random variables associated with measurement errors in output and other 
noise in the data which are beyond the control of firms.  
vi are assumed to be 
independently and identically distributed 
N(0,  v2) and independent of the 
ui. In the 
absence of the stochastic term 
ui, the model in (1) reduces to a purely deterministic 
(mean) production function. The 
ui are defined as non-negative random variables 
which account for technical inefficiency effects in production and are independently 
distributed as truncations at zero of the 
N(µi, u2) distribution, where:  
  k  
µi = 0 +    k zik 
+ i                                                  
 (2 )  k-1  
 and zi is a (1 × 
K) vector of farm characteristics that affect efficiency and 
 is an (
K × 1) vector of parameters to be estimated. The 
i™s are random variables generally 
defined by the truncation of the normal distribution with zero mean and variance 
2, 
with the point of truncation as 
i  -  zi.  Maximum likelihood methods are used to simultaneously estimate the stochastic 

frontier and technical inefficiency effect
s models. For the likelihood function the 
variance terms are parameterized as:  
 2= 2u+ 2V and  = 2u / (2u+ 2V ), with 0 
    1 (Battese and Coelli,1995) 
  
Technical inefficiency for the 
i-th farm is estimated as the expectation of 
ui, conditional on the observed value of (
vi - ui):   k  
TEi = E[exp(-ui) | v
i Œ ui] = E[exp(-
0 -  k zik - 
i | vi Œ ui ]  k-1 
 
  15iii. Empirical model 
 We use a Cobb-Douglas functional form to specify the stochastic production 
frontier. Taylor et al. (1986) argued that as long as interest rests on efficiency 
measurement and not on the analysis of the general structure of the production 
technology, the Cobb-Douglas production function provides an adequate 

representation of the production technology. Moreover examining the impact of 
functional form on efficiency Kopp and Smith (1980) concluded ‚–.that functional 
specification has a discernible but rather small impact on estimated efficiency". That 
is why the Cobb-Douglas functional form has been widely used in farm efficiency 
analyses both in developing and develope
d countries (Battese. 1992: Bravo-Ureta and 
Pinheiro, 1993). The specific model estimated is given by: 
  5  
In Y =  0  + 
  i  ln  Xi  + ri - ui                 -  (1 )
  i=1
   Where 
Y = Yield in Kgs 
X1 = Fertilizer in kgs 
X2 = Manure in kgs 
X3 = Labour in man days 
X4 = Machinery in hours 
X5 = Irrigation in nos 
 The technical inefficiency is modelled as: 
 7  
ui =    +     m Z mi                                      - (2 )
  m=1  Where,  Z1 = Education in years 
Z2 = Access to road  in kms 
Z3 = Credit, 1 if availed credit /0 otherwise 
Z4 = Extension contact in nos/month 
  16The computer package developed by Coelli for Stochastic Frontier Production, 
FRONTIER Version 4.1, is used for estimation of the above model. 

 
d. Infrastructure and private capital formation 
 Public investment in agriculture has been declining since mid-1980s which is likely to 
have adverse impact over the longer term be
cause investments in irrigation, roads, and 
education have been shown to significantly contribute to agricultural productivity 
growth and the reduction of rural poverty in India. This trend has not been offset by 
an increase in private investment. It is very pertinent to note the observation of 
Sawant,et al (2002) on  investment by cultivator households. In cultivator households, 

proportion of investing households was as 
low as 19.3 per cent in 1971-72 and came 
down to just 11.89per cent in 1991-92. One of the enabling factors for creation of an 
environment for private investment is increasing public investment in infrastructure, 
though there is differing views on the complementarity between public and private 
investments in agriculture.  By and large the general observation in the literature is 
that the public sector investment has an inducement effect on private investment. 
Nevertheless, movement of public and private investments in diverse directions since 
mid-1980s instigated a controversy regarding the weakening of the complementarity 

between the two (Mishra and Chand 1995; Misra and Hazell 1996; Mitra 1996). In 
this study the impact of differential public
 infrastructure on private capital formation 
in Tamil Nadu is analyzed in two districts one with high infrastructure endowment 
namely, Namakkal and the other with low infrastructure endowment, namely 

Ramanathapuram district by specifying the following log Œlog model:

 5. The Study Area 
 
Tamil Nadu is India™s seventh largest state with a population of about 62 million and 
with a geographical area of 130 million he
ctares. The Gross State Domestic Product 
(GSDP) growth rate was 6.3per cent during the 1990s, ahead of the all India average 
of 6.1per cent. Tamil Nadu™s performance with respect to the Human Development 
Index (HDI) is also impressive; it ranks thir
d among 29 states. This is especially true 
for human development indicato
rs like female life expectan
cy, female mortality rate, 
and access to safe drinking water etc. Notwithstanding these achievements, Tamil 
Nadu is still a low-income state and has a 
relatively high incidence of poverty (20 per 
cent) and  unemployment (14 per cent) in the country. There are intra-state disparities 
in key poverty and social indicators. About 12 million people live in poverty, and 
inequality in Tamil Nadu is higher than the all-India average, and is in fact, the 
highest among the fifteen major states. This uneven improvement in the quality of life 
has left a large section of the population which has consistently failed to benefit from 
the economic and social development that the state has achieved. Sixty-five percent of 

the States population is living in rural areas, with agriculture as the main profession. 
Agricultural land holdings in the state are very small in size along with high degree of 
fragmentation, with 74 per cent of the holdings below one hectare in size and nearly 
90 per cent of them below 2 hectares. The net sown area in the State is 5.09 m ha and 

50.97 per cent of the net sown area is irriga
ted. About 30 per cent of the net irrigated 
area is irrigated by canals, 21 per cent by
 tanks and 49 per cent is fed by wells. Rain 
fed agriculture employing about 25 per cent 
of farmers accounts for 46 per cent of the 
net sown area of 5.5 million hectares. Rural poverty is concentrated among those with 
marginal landholdings and dependent on 
rain-fed agriculture. Recurring droughts and 
price crashes due to seasonal gluts increase the vulnerability of these sections due to 
income variations. Investment in infrastructure like irrigation, road, education, 
markets, etc., would in the long run reduce these vulnerability and enable the small 
and marginal farmers to participate in the new development process ushered in by the 
liberalization and globalization of the economy. 
 186. Data source and analysis 
 District wise panel data was collected for 5 years from 1998-99 to 2003-04. Due to 
reorganization of districts, th
e data set could not be collected for earlier years. Also 
the spatial variation in infrastructure is more significant than the temporal variation. 
For example, the irrigated area was 2.71 million ha in 1971-72 and 2.801 million ha in 
2001-02. Similarly the density of road per ‚000 sq km of geographical area was 1117 
km in 97-98 and 1384 km in 2002-03. But there is spatial variability in irrigation 

intensity and road density among the 28 districts in the state as evidenced from the 
coefficient of variation. Coefficient of
 variation was 74 per cent for irrigation 
intensity and 38 per cent for road density in the state.

The data was also collected from Commissionerate Agricultural Marketing and Agri 
 19Business, Commissionerate of Agriculture, District Rural Development Agency, and 
Tamil Nadu Co-Operative Union. Primary data for the study pertains to the farm-
survey of two districts, each representing differential infrastructural endowments. 
Samples were collected from six villages in Namakkal district and six villages in 
Ramanathapuram district. A total of 120 farmers from these 12 villages were 
selected following random sampling procedure (vide table.1). Technical efficiency 

analysis was carried out for paddy crop which is major crop in Namakkal and in 
Ramanathapuram district. 
 
7. Results 

 a. Infrastructure and productivity  
 The influence of infrastructural variables on Total Factor Productivity is modeled in 

equation-4. The important infrastructural variables included in the model are 
irrigation intensity, road density, market
s and commercial vehicles. Other production 
related variables like percent of area under 
High Yielding Varieties and rain fall were 
included to isolate the effect of theses variables on TFP. The descriptive statistics of 
the variables used in the model is presented in the table.2 

 The equation-4 is estimated under three assumptions about the intercept of the model. 
a. The usual OLS regression using pooled data (OLS-PD), ignores space and 
time dimension and hence it is highly restricted. It assumes intercept value 

is same for all the districts (OLS-PD).  
b. The Fixed Effects Model (FEM) or Least Square Dummy Variable 
(LSDV) model overcomes this limitation through differential intercept 
dummies. In this model intercept may vary across districts but each 
district™s intercept does not vary over time. It means intercept is time 

invariant.   
c. Just as dummy variables are used to account district effect, dummy 
variables are used to account for ti
me effect, making the intercept time 
variant (LSDV-TV).

  Irrigation, roads, markets and literacy are th
e important infrastructural variables which 
had significant positive influence on total factor productivity. These infrastructure are 
created mostly through public investment 
and indirectly contribute to productivity 
growth. The results show that the densit
y of commercial vehicles and agricultural 
pumpsets did not have statistically significa
nt influence total factor productivity. This 
is probably because the impact of agricult
ural pumpsets is more systematically 
captured by irrigation variable and the commercial vehicles by the road density 
variable. Among the infrastructure variable
, the marginal impact of irrigation 
infrastructure was higher as shown by the regression coefficient, while the impact of 
roads, literacy and markets followed in that order. As Tamil Nadu has a very 
moderate rainfall with high variability in di
stribution, irrigation plays a crucial role in 
increasing and stabilizing agricultural produc
tivity in many parts of the state. Hence, 
improving irrigation infrastructure shall continue to be the major priority for public 
investment. Among the non-infrastructural variables affecting total factor 
productivity, rainfall alone turned out to be significant. The variable high yielding 
variety was not significant probably due to th
e fact that the coverage of high yielding 
 22varieties is limited to few important crops
 and the area under high yielding varieties 
remained more or less stable over the period of study. The results clearly demonstrate 
the role of infrastructure in increasing the total factor productivity in agriculture.  
 b. Infrastructure and diversification  

 In the early stages of agricultural development with very low level of infrastructure, 
any increase in the stock of infrastructure represents wider choices to the farmers with 
regard to inputs, crops, markets etc. At this stage, there bound to be more 
diversification of crops with the increase in infrastructure. In advanced stages of 
development, when infrastructure integrates markets and farmers attempt to reap the 

comparative advantage, infrastructure growth leads to specialization. The equation-5, 
try to capture the nature of influence the infrastructure have on crop diversification in 
the study region. The results of the model are presented in Tables 4.

  23The result of the time variant Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV-TV) model is 
discussed as this model excludes spatio-temporal effects in the data (For estimates of 
OLS-PD and FEM model Vide 
appendix ŒII). . Except pump
sets, all the other four 
infrastructural variables turned out to be st
atistically significant. 
Irrigation intensity, 
input-output markets and commercial vehicl
es had significant positive influence on 
crop diversification. But road density has significant negative influence on 

diversification. As some of the earlier 
studies suggested (For example, Kurosaki, 
2003; Benin et al, 2004) this may be due to the fact that the road infrastructure helps 
specialization in agriculture to ex
ploit the comparative advantage. 
 c. Rural Infrastructure and Efficiency in agricultural production 
 
A summary of the values of the variables used
 in the analysis is presented in .Table 5

 Farmers in Namakkal obtained higher average crop output per hectare of land 

compared to Ramnad. Similarly it is interesting to note that manure use, which is a 
bulky input; and machinery use, mostly tractor for which road access is necessary, 
is more in Namakkal district. Similarly the standard deviation in input use is also 
relatively small in Namakkal diatrict except for labour. Good infrastructural 
facilities could be one of the reasons for labour migration resulting in instability in 

availability for agriculture. 

 Farmers in both the districts have comparably
 the average level of credit availability 
while the educational status was higher in Namakkal district with an average level 
of 8 years of schooling compared to the 6 years of schooling in Ramanathapuram 

district. The access to road from the farm was on an averge 0.62 kms in Namakkal 
while it was 1.89 km in Ramanathapuram district. The extension contacts were 
observed to be more with an average of nearly 5 per month in Namakkal compared 
to the mere 1.70 in Ramnad district.   
  25The maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) of the parameters of Cobb-Douglas 
stochastic frontier function were obtained using maximum-likelihood procedures 
through  FRONTIER 4.1 package. The results are presented in the Table 7 and 8. 
The homogeneity of the two data set were tested through a pooled regression with 
dummy variable and found that the dummy variable was significant (vide appendix 
-3). Hence the the regressions for two districts were estimated separately.

. there is not random noise (Battese and Coelli. 
1995). The estimated value of 
  is close to 1 in the two models and is significantly 
different from zero, thereby, establishing the fact that inefficiencies exists in these 
two districts. Further, Likelihood Ratio (LR) test statistic was used to test 
different inefficiency specifications.  The null hypothesis that 
= 0 is rejected at 
 27the 5%, level of significance confirming that inefficiency exit and are indeed 
stochastic (LR statistics 78.68 and 51.69 >

  28The results also indicate that technical efficiency (TE) indices range from 49.19 per 
cent to 99.08 per cent in Namakal district, with an average of 88.94 per cent (Table 
9). This indicates that, if the average farmer in the sample was to achieve the TE 
level of its most efficient counterpart, then the average farmer could realize a 10 per 
cent (1-[88.94/99.08]) cost savings. Similarly in Ramanathapuram district, technical 
efficiency (TE) indices range
 from 17.43 per cent to 95.73 per cent, with an average 
of 82.30 per cent (Table 10).  An average farmer could realize a 14 per cent cost 
savings (1-[82.30/95.73]) if he was to achieve the TE level of his most efficient 
counterpart. 
 Factors explaining inefficiency 
 The parameter estimates of the inefficiency effects stochastic production frontier 
model employed to identify the factors in
fluencing farmers™ levels of technical 
inefficiency are given by 
s in  Table 7 & 8. The results show that education, the 
distance of the plot from the main access road and credit access have a significant 
impact on technical inefficiency of farmers in Namakkal district while education and  

the distance of the plot from the main access road  have significant inefficiency 
effect in Ramanathapuram district. Access to road  is an important variable in 
determining  the technical efficiency in agricultural production as it facilitates 
movement of bulky farm inputs and outputs in a cost effective way. It also enables the 
use of heavy machinery like tractors and combined harvesters which result in timely 
agricultural operations. The results clearly establish that technical inefficiency in-
creases with the distance of the plot from the main access road and underscores the 

importance of better infrastructure in agricultural development. Similarly an icrease 
in education significanly reduces the inefficiency. The negative and significant impact 
of credit on technical inefficiency in Namakkal district implies that access to cash 
credit is likely to enhance the technical e
fficiency of farmers in this district. The 
agricultural extension system did not influe
nce technical efficiency significantly.  
  29d. Infrastructure and private capital formation 
 
The impact of public infrastructure on private capital formation in Tamil Nadu is 
analyzed in two districts, one with high infrastructure endowment and the other with 
low infrastructure endowment. The pooled data of the two districts was first estimated 
to test the homogeneity of the data. The district dummy variable was not statistically 

significant implying that the two data sets are homogenous. This implies that the 
differential public infrastructure endowment 
is not significantly influencing private 
capital formation in agriculture. The mean 
and standard deviation of the explanatory 
variables in the capital formation 
function is given in table. 11.

 The model specified to analyze the determinants of private capital formation at farm 
level have shown that non Œ farm income, irrigated area and access to road are the 

important variables that affected capital formation at farm level. The results are 

presented in the table. 12.  It is important note that non farm income significantly 
influences the capital formation in agriculture. Agricultural income alone is not 

generating sufficient surpluses for investment 
in farming. The next important variable 
that affects capital formation is irrigation.
 Recurrence of drought and monsoon failure 
results in spending off one or two y
ears™ savings in a drought year. Irrigated 
agriculture to some extent protects crops
 from monsoon failure and produce sufficient 
surpluses for investment in the farm.  Access to road influences capital formation 
(significant at 10 per cent level of probability
), as the distance of the farm increase

 from road,  the capital formation declines. Access to agricultural research institutes 
and farm level diversification have not influenced capital formation in a significant 
way.
  
8. Conclusion 

 Cereal based small farm agriculture in the State of Tamil Nadu in India is facing the 
challenge of accelerating crop productivity a
nd diversification of crops in the context 
of declining public investment and in the globalizing economy. The results of the 
study clearly establish that the 
investments in rural infrastru
cture like irrigation, rural 
markets, and roads increase the total factor productivity in Tamil Nadu agriculture. 
But public investment in agriculture has been declining in real terms in the 90s. It is 

imperative that stepping up investment in rural infrastructure is not only essential to 
accelerate agricultural productivity but also to secure livelihoods for two-third of the 

population in the State in the emerging global economic order. The results show the 

effect of infrastructure on diversification 
is mixed. While irrigation intensity, the 
markets and commercial vehicles had pos
itive significant influence on crop 
diversification, road density had significa
nt negative influence on diversification. 
 31Some earlier studies also reported that road infrastructure was instrumental in 
specialization of agriculture for reaping the benefits of comparative advantage, thus 
reducing diversification. Stochastic frontier production function estimation revealed 
that higher infrastructure endowments aid in achieving higher level of technical 
efficiency in agricultural production. The inefficiency in pr
oduction is explained by 
deficiency in some of the factors like education, the distance of the plot from the 

main access road and access to credit. The analysis of private capital formation in 
Tamil Nadu revealed that the differential public infrastructure endowment was not 
significantly influencing private capital formation in agriculture. The important 
determinants of private capital formation at farm level were non Œ farm income, 
irrigated area and access to road.  

 Ways to enable the small and marginal farmers in developing countries are being 
increasingly debated among academicians and policymakers. The results clearly 
establish the rural infrastructure are important determinants of total factor productivity 
and efficiency in agricultural production. Since significant increases in public 
investment in rural infrastructure seem unlikely, Governments will have to give 
greater emphasis in using their public investment resources more efficiently. This 
requires better targeting of investment to achieve better efficiency. The results of the 

study would be a step in this direction.
