Poultry Broiler Farming
 
1.
 
Introduction
 
Poultry meat is an important source of high quality proteins, minerals and vitamins to balance the 
human diet. Specially developed varieties of chicken (broilers) are now available with the traits of 
quick growth 
and high feed conversion efficiency. Depending on the farm size, broiler farming can be 
a main source of family income or can provide subsidiary income and gainful employment to farmers 
throughout the year. Poultry manure is of high fertilizer 
value which 
can be used for increasing yield of all crops.
 
The advantages of broiler farming are
 
a)
 
Initial investment is lower than layer farming
 
b)
 
Rearing period is 5
-
6 weeks only 
 
c)
 
More number of flocks can be taken in the same 
shed
 
d)
 
Broilers have high feed conversion eff
iciency i.e. the amount of feed required for unit body 
weight gain is lower in comparison to other livestock
 
e)
 
Faster return from the investment 
 
f)
 
Demand for poultry meat is more compared to sheep/goat meat
 
 
2.
 
Scope for broiler farming and its national 
importance
 
 
India has made tremendous progress in broiler production during the last three decades and the broiler 
population in the country during 2011
-
12 stood at 2300 million. Today India is the fifth largest 
producer of broiler meat in the world with a
n annual production of 2.47 million MT. Despite this 
achievement, the per capita availability of poultry meat in India is only 2.96 kg which is way below 
the ICMR recommendation of 11 kg meat per capita per annum.
 
The growth of the poultry sector is mainly
 
attributed to the interventions of the corporate sector with 
an enabling policy environment provided by the Government of India / State Governments from time 
to time. The activity provides huge employment opportunities for the rural poor either under Back
yard 
poultry production system or under small scale commercial broiler farming units. Over 5 million 
people are engaged in the poultry sector either directly or indirectly.
 
Owing to the considerable growth in broiler industry, high quality chicks, 
equipment, vaccines and 
medicines, technically and professionally competent guidance are available to the farmers. The 
management practices have improved and disease and mortality incidences are reduced to a great 
extent. Many institutions are providing tr

Central/ State governments and poultry corporations is being given to create infrastructure facilities so 
that new entrepreneurs are attracted to take up this business. Broiler farming has been given 
considerable importance in the national policy and has a good scope for further development in the 
years to come.

Integration in Broiler Farming
 
 
There is a growing trend of in
tegration in broiler farming.  In t
he early nineties, contract farming for 
broil
ers was introduced and i
n 1995 it spread all over Tamil N
adu. Between 1995 and 2000, it spread 
to Karnataka. It gathered momentum and spread its wings to Mah
arashtra, Andhra Pradesh in the 
years 2001 & 2002 and after that, it gained inroads into West Benga
l and Gujarat. The spread is due 
 
 
to in built strengths in integration system. Integrators take
s
 
care of all aspects of production, right 
from raising of grandparent and parent flocks, production of day old chicks for rearing, manufacturing 
and supply of concentrate feed, providing veterinary services and wholesale marketing of birds. Under 
integrati
on all the previous profit centres of the broiler industry viz. chick selling, feed selling, 
hatching, medicine supply, transportation have become cost centres for the integrators who work as a 
single entity and distribute the benefits among the farmer, co
nsumer and the integration company 
themselves. Under contract farming, poultry farmers invest only for poultry sheds / equipment on 
their existing land. The Integrator supplies chicks, feed, and medicines, provides technical guidance 
and also buy back / pu
rchase the entire production after 5
-
6 weeks. The contract farmers are paid
 
rearing charges usually on per kg Live Weight basis and also as per the set of criteria prescribed by 
the integrators viz., FCR, Mortality etc. Farmer is benefiting from the lesser
 
investment and 
production cost and also higher productivity which are achieved as a result of integration. Moreover 
3
 
 
he
/she
 
is insulated from the market price fluctuations. However, the farmer may be at a disadvantage 
if the number of batches supplied in t
he year by the integrator is less.
 
 
4.
 
Financial assistance available from Banks for broiler farming
 
For poultry farming schemes with large outlays Detailed Project Reports (DPR) are required to be 
prepared. The items of investment / finance would include con
struction of broiler sheds and purchase 
of equipment, cost of day old chicks, feed, medicine and labour cost for the first cycle. Cost towards 

vehicles, broi
ler dressing, processing and cold storage facilities can also be considered for providing 
credit. 
For high value projects, the borrowers can 
utilise the services of NABARD Consultancy 
Services (NABCONS) 
who are 
having 
wide 
experience in 
preparation of Deta
iled Project Reports.

Project formulation for bank loan
 
 
5.1.
 
 
A project can be prepared by the promoter after consulting local technical persons of State 
Veterinary / Animal Husbandry department, Poultry Corporation or private commercial 
broiler 
hatcheries
. If
 
possible, they should also visit the progressive broiler farmers in the area and 
discuss the profitability of farming. A good practical training and experience on a broiler farm 
will be highly desirable, before starting a broiler farm.
 
5.2.
 
The project should 
include the following information on technical, financial and managerial 
aspects in detail based on type of unit and capacity.

Appraisal of the project
 
The project so formulated considering the above mentioned aspects should be submitted to the nearest 
branch of the bank for availing credit facility for establishment of the broiler farm. 
The bank will then 
examine the project for its technical feasibility, financial viability and bankability.
 
5
 
 
7.
 
Sanction of Bank loan and its disbursement
 
After ensuring technical feasibility and financial viability, the project is sanctioned by the bank. The 
loan is disbursed mostly in 2 stages viz., construction of sheds / other civil structures, purchase of 
equipment and machinery, recurring cost on purchase of chicks, feeds, medicines, etc. The end use of 
the loan is verified and constant follow up / monito
ring is done by the bank.
 
8. Lending terms 
-
 
General
 
8.1 Outlay:
 
Outlay of the project depends on the local conditions, unit size and the investment components 
included in the project. Prevailing market prices / cost may be considered to arrive at the outl
ay.
 
8.2 Margin Money:
 
Margin depends on the category of the borrowers and may range from 10% to 25%.
 
8.3 Interest Rate:
 
Banks are free to decide the interest rates within overall RBI guidelines. However, for working out 
financial viability and bankability 
of model project, the rate of interest is assumed at 12.50% p.a.
 
8.4 Security:
 
Security will be as per RBI / NABARD guidelines issued from time to time.
 
8.5 Repayment of loan
:
 
The loan repayment is determined, on the basis of gross surplus generated in the
 
project. Usually the 
repayment period of loan for broiler farming is 6 to 8 years. 
 
8.6 Insurance:
 
The birds and other assets (poultry shed, equipment) may be insured. Wherever necessary 
Risk/Mortality fund may be considered in lieu of poultry insurance.
