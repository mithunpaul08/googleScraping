Optimizing the Herd Size in Urban Dairy 
Farming in Tamil Nadu Œ A Quadratic Function 
Approach
KEYWORDS : 
 Optimum Farm Size Œ Pro˜t 
Maximization - Quadratic Production Function.
ABSTRACT
˜e Study was under taken to ˚nd out the optimum farm size in urban dairy farming in Tamil Nadu. A total 
sample size of 180 dairy cow farmers was selected from three urban milk shed areas of Tamil Nadu namely Chennai 
(Tambaram), Erode and Vellore for the present study. ˜e farms were classi˚ed into small, medium and large based on the number of cows. 
To ˚nd out the optimum number of dairy cows to be maintained in the di˛erent farm size category, Quadratic function was used in which 

net pro˚t per farm was taken as dependent variable and the farm size was taken as independent variable. ˜e results of Quadratic function 

revealed that the optimum size was found to be 2.97, 4.76 and 10.6 respectively in small, medium and large farms and the average size of 

dairy farms were 1.66, 3.91 and 7.91 respectively in these categories of farms. ˜is revealed that the average size of the dairy farms was far 

below the optimal size. Hence the maximum possible pro˚t was not realized from these farms. From the results, it could be inferred that the 

small, medium and large categories of dairy farms should maintain at least 3, 5 and 10 cows respectively to reap up the maximum possible 

potential pro˚t in the study area. 
INTRODUCTION
During the last three decades, our Nation™s milk producers have 

transformed Indian dairying from stagnation to world leader
-ship. In India, dairying is recognized as an instrument for social 

and economic development. ˚e Nation™s milk supply comes 

from millions of small producers. India ranks ˜rst in the world 

in milk production (127.9 million tonnes). ˚e per capita avail
-
ability of milk is 290 grams in 2012-2013. Milk emerged as one 

of the biggest contributor to the value of agricultural output in 

the country. Increase in milk production with limited resources 

like quality and quantity of feed, labour, genetic potential of the 

animal and to ensure the optimal use of various inputs used by 

the milk producers is matter of primary concern. It is important 

to know whether the inputs owned by milk producers are used 

e˛ciently or not. However, dairy farmers in urban areas are still 

faced with key decisions on how best to produce milk and what 

will be the optimum farm size to achieve maximum pro˜t with 

their given limited resources. ˚us, the main objective of this 

study is to conduct non linear production function analyses of 

dairy farms in the urban areas of Tamil Nadu. Similar study was 

carried out by Normand and William (2012). ˚e results derived 

from the analyses may assist agricultural economic advisors and 

dairy extension agents to advise farmers on how to optimize the 

farm size so as to receive maximum pro˜t with the scarce fac
-
tors of production. ˚e results may also provide dairy farmers 

and policy-makers with a better insight into the optimum num
-
ber of animals to be allocated in a farm for pro˜t maximization 

in urban areas of Tamil Nadu.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In Tamil Nadu
, three urban milk shed areas namely Chennai 

(Tambaram), Erode and Vellore were selected for the present 

study. From each of these areas, 60 dairy farmers were selected 

by Simple random sampling technique. In all, a total sample size 

of 180 dairy farmers was selected for the present study.
Period of study: 
˚e ˜eld survey for this study was conducted during the month 

of November and December 2013 and the data was collected 

from the sample units related to the year 2013.
Collection of data: 
Information relating to various aspects of dairy farming was col
-
lected from selected farmers by survey method with a well-de
-
signed and pre-tested interview schedule. Details of inputs used 
like green fodder, dry fodder, concentrates with their quantities 

and price, labour employed with wage particulars veterinary and 

breeding expenses, miscellaneous expenses and data on outputs 

like milk, manure and gunny bag were also collected from the 

dairy farmers. ˚e data collected are analyzed with a view to 

achieve the objectives of the study as follows:
Analytical Framework:
˚e non linear production function was used to estimate the op
-
timum size of the farm, so as to receive maximum pro˜t (Bose, 

1992). ˚e quadratic production functional analysis was used 

which relates the pro˜t per farm as dependent variable and the 

farm size as independent variable. Similar study was conducted 

in broiler farming (Jebarani and Pandian, 2006). Net pro˜t per 

farm was worked out by subtracting the total cost (sum of the 

˜xed cost and variable cost of the farm) from the total return.
˜e simple quadratic function was de˚ned as follows:
Y = a +b1X + b2X2Y = Net pro˜t per farm (Rs.)

X = Farm size (number of animals)
 
Di˝erentiating the above equation would yield the pro˜t maxi
-mizing level of herd size i.e. by equating dy
p/dx = 0.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

˚e observations
 from the study revealed that there was a 
skewed distribution of the farms with the dominance of small 

farms was the characteristics of the urban dairy farming i.e. 

among the total 180 sample dairy farms, 112 were small farms 

(62.2 per cent), 46 were medium farms (25.5 per cent) and 22 

were large farms (12.2 per cent). ˚is might be due to the availa

bility of space, funds, market potential and the preference of the 

farmers could also contribute to the determination of farm size. 

˚e average net pro˜t per farm per day was found to be around 

INR.126 (range from INR.32 to INR.400). In the total cost, vari

able cost accounted for more than 90 per cent in all the farms. 

˚is was in accordance with the ˜ndings of Rajendran (1986) 

and Ganesan (1986).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
˚e study of optimization of farm size in urban dairy farms of 

Tamil Nadu revealed that the average size of dairy farms were 

1.66, 3.91 and 7.91 respectively in small, medium and large farms 

and the optimum size was found to be 2.97, 4.76 and 10.6 respec
-
tively in these categories of farms. From the results, it could be 

inferred that the small, medium and large categories of dairy 

farms should maintain at least 3, 5 and 10 animals respectively 

to reap up the maximum possible potential pro˜t from urban 

milk production in the study area.
