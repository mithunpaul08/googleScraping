if all the famers cooperate and adopt appropriate

extensive nature (87%). All the farmers Some of the shrimp farmers 
fc, strengthen the association 
so that it can supervise 
and control each and every operation in all farms and enforce 
necessary regulations. The association has self-regulated shrimp culture 
in the cluster since 1998. 
Pond preparation and stocking 
The association meets well ahead of 
pond preparation and 
form teams to supervise preparatory works. The Association forms teams for seed 
procurement. The stocking density 
and number of ponds to be stocked depending on the availability of 
water were decided in the meeting. Based 
on the requirements a team 
was deputed to 
book seed 
in bulk 
from one or two 
reputable hatcheries 
(near Marakkanam). The team was 
responsible for screening 
the seed for disease 
and transporting it to farm sites. The association does not permit stocking wild seed. When the 
number of shrimp ponds increased, more than one team was formed to procure quality seed. The supply of 
other inputs like feed 
is arranged on credit basis 
providing guarantee 
by the association. All the ponds are stocked 
simultaneously or within a week. 
If any farmer fails to stock within 10 
days, he was not allowed to stock for next 60 days. The stocking density 
is @ 5 post larvae per square meter and the survival 
rate averages 80-90%. 
The total feed consumption is about 1.2 to 1.4 tonnesl ha with a feed conversion ratio 
(FCR) of 1.2to 1.4. Pond management 
Ponds are monitored round the clock 
by observing the check tray and the 
behavior of shrimps. In order to reap 
successful crop for all, the association 
enforces some regulations on its members and it 
is considered the moral 
duty of all 
the farmers 
to follow them strictly. All 
the farms 
should have a reservoir of minimum 
10% of its total water spread area 
and chlorination of reservoir is compulsory. All 
farms should 
employ technicians 
and consultants authorized by the association. 
If a farmer wants to try a new input, permission 
needs to 
be obtained from the association. If any disease problem 
arises during the culture, 
it must be brought to the immediate notice of the 
association. The association recommends for premature harvesting 
or bleaching of the pond, based on the 
size of the shrimplday of culture. 
The association also supervises 
the process of bleaching and reimburses the 
cost of seed and bleaching powder. 
Harvesting, production 
and marketing The association collects quotations from 
the available traders 
and decides 
the price for the produce on competitive basis. It bargains for better prices 
and advises the same to the members. 
The farmer can 
sell his produce 
according to his wish 
and bargain again 
with the available bidders to get 
more. Shrimp harvesting is normally done after 120 
days of culture when 
they have attained 
30 g size. 
In some cases the culture period is extended to 130 - 150 days 
to get a good 
size. Harvested shrimps are mainly handpicked 
from the outlet, 
cleaned, segregated, weighed and 
iced. Average production 
is about 1.5 tonnesl ha (30 
tailskg). Creation and maintenance of 
common infrastructure 
The association has created common infrastructure like a supply canal 
for sea 
water, approach 
roads, common 
inlet canals and drainage. 
The responsibility to maintain them properly 
has been bestowed on the members. 
However, the association bares the cost of repairs. 
Membership and organization 
Membership is compulso~y for all farmers. A membership fee of Rs.5001- and monthly subscription 
of Rs.501- per pond is 
paid to the association. 
A president heads the association 
with a secretary and a treasurer 
and all are 
elected dernocraticaliy. While choosing 
the office bearers experience 
in shrimp farming and exposure 
to different agencies working with shrimp culture 
were given 
preference. An honorarium is paid to the secretary 
for carrying out the association work. The members share common expenses. Whenever some money was urgently needed either 
the association or 
office bearers 
spend it 
initially and 
recoup later. The association normally 
meets once per 
month, attendance at the meetings is compulsory and 
repeated absence 
warrants proscription. Resolutions are 
prepared and passed 
unanimously after detailed discussion. 
Other activities 
The association help its members to 
obtain licenses from the Aquaculture 
Authority by providing nccessary documents obtained from revenue authorities, prepare 
their applications, and submit 
them to the District Committee and 
follow-up for their 
clearance. It adjudicates 
the disputes among members amicably through discussion and 
persuasion. It has close Common infrastructure

April-June 2003 (Vol. Vlll No. 2) contacts with district and regional 
level associations and deputes inembers for meetings and cooperates with them for 
promotion of 
shrimp culture. It maintains good rapport 
with the local people and it takes utmost care to prevent any 
negatlve impact on them. It also offers generous donations for festivals. 
schools and other charitable works. 
It interacts closely 
with the district 
administration and 
gets development schemes for the welfare 
of the local community. Success of the association The members as well as farnlers from adjoining areas have 
been witness to the successful functioning 
of this association. Since 1998 they have rased successful shrimp 
crops and 
obtained good harvests. 
The farmers attribute 
their success 
to the association, which 
has ensured supply 
of quality seed, convinced the companies/suppliers for credit facilities for inputs 
and attracted new farnlers into its fold as evidenced by the expansion of area under 
shrimp farming. The association has brought 
unity among the farmers, 
secured fair 
price for the produce, provided a 
platform for exchanging views, 
sharing their knowledge among the farmers and it has 
ensured harmony 
with the local 
people. Strengthening the 
association Registration of the association 
as a legal 
body under 
relevant government provisions will strengthen its activities. 
Even credit, insurance 
and licenses may be issued only 
to the association, 
whlch has holistic approach for development of sustainable aquaculture 
in the farm 
cluster. Financial assistance 
may be 
given to such groups for 
developing infrastructure like wastewater treatment 
plants, cold storage facilities 
etc. Farmers' representatives from the association may 
be included in the District and State level committees of the Aquaculture Authority 
to share their views in the planning process. Besides 
village level associations, 
there may be 
an active district level 
fanners committee and a dynamic 
farmers' federation at 
state level 
which can take care 
of the interests of shrimp farmers and function 
as an influential body. Accordingly the 
shrimp farmers associations should 
be Scientist investfgator with office bearers linked organically. The president and 
secretary of every 
ossociatio~i can become the members of 
the district committee and the president and 
secretary of all 
district committees can become the ex-officlo members of the farmers' federation 
at state level. This wlll ~romote interaction and co-

information through mass 
media on current price situation 
so that the 
farmers can

in the shrimp farms. 
Conclusion The study has clearly indicated 
the following points. 
Farmers/farmer groups and their 
voluntary code 
of conduct are very important for sustainable shrimp aquaculture. Quality inputs 
and proper 
falming practices are essential for successful 
skimp farming. Shrimp farming 
practiced with due consideration to environment and 
other stakeholders will help in eliminating social and 
environmental conflicts. The success of the Thambikottai- Vadakadu shrimp farmers association 
in sustaining shrimp farming 
is an eye-opener and 
more such 
Farmers groups/associations are the need of 
the hour. This could 
be assisted through provision 
of incentives by the government. Employment The assoclatlon ensures that 
local or nearby villagers alone are employed in local shrimp farms. On an average, two permanent labourers are employed per hectare of farm for 
carrying out regular operations and they stay 
at the farm throughout the 
culture period. Casual laborers are engaged 
during pond The authors are grateful to Dr.Mathew Abraham, Director, CIBA for his encouragement and guidance. They are thankful to Dr. P.Ravichandran, Principal Scientist and Head, Crustacean Culture 
Division, CIBA for his critical review and suggestions.
