productivity surpassing Karnataka and 

Gujarat.  Similarly, in productivity of 

sugarcane, it is the Numero Uno State and 

its productivity is nearly 45 percent more 
than the National average.  In the case of 

vegetables and fruits productivity, it ranked

the agricultural sector is complex. The 

productivity has stagnated in the recent years 


b) depleting water resources, c) escalating 

inputs costs, d) increased incidence of 



health as a consequence of indiscriminate 

use of chemical inputs, f) low level of post 
harvest technology, g) uncertain market 

prospects, and h) relatively higher incidence 

of indebtedness of farmers (Swaminathan, 
2010). In addition to the above, marginalization 
of land holdings, high variability in rainfall 

distribution, pressure of expanding habitat 

intruding into farm space, inadequate capital 

formation by the public sector and declining 
public investment in agriculture affect the 

agricultural performance in the State.  Salient Features of AgricultureThe salient features of Tamil Nadu's 




present concentration of cultivation from 

water intensive crops like rice and sugarcane 

to more nutritious but less water consuming 

crops like pulses, millets, oilseeds and so 

on in terms of total irrigated land and b) 

predominance of small and marginal farmers 
in overall agriculture production. Dominance of Small and Marginal 
FarmersThe distribution of landholding is 
skewed towards small and marginal farmers 
and the average size of holding is low.  The 

semi-medium, medium and large farmers 

accounted for a small proportion (9 percent) 

of the holdings but operating a higher 

proportion (41 percent) of the total area.  The 

average size of holding was higher in the 
case of large farmers (20.59 ha.) followed 

by medium farmers (5.61 ha).  The overall 
average size of land holding had come down 

from 0.83 ha. in 2005-06 to 0.80 ha. in 2010-

11. (Graph 3.1.1). Graph 3.1.1: Land Holding Pattern in Tamil Nadu (in Lakh Nos) Source : Dept. of Economics and Statistics, GoTNThe reduction in land holding size in 
Tamil Nadu directly affects the productivity 

as the farmer would not be able to afford 
the investments required for technological 
improvements. Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 

envisages functional consolidation of holdings 

through cooperative farming, contract farming 

and other mechanisms such as farmer 

groups and joint liability groups and implies 

the urgent need to increase the penetration 

of modern agricultural technologies and 

improve output.62.66 (77%)

area in the State. An analysis of time series 

data on net cultivated area and land put to 

non-agricultural uses in the State clearly 

reveals the above fact. (Graph. 3.1.2)  Land 
put to non-agricultural purposes increased 

from 9.8 percent in 1950s to 14.56 percent in  

1990s and reached 16.17 percent in 2000s, 

which is mainly due to urbanization and 
industrialization.  The trend in decrease in 

net area sown was analyzed and the net area 
sown came down from 56.38 Lakh hectares 
(L.ha) in 1950s to 50.22 L.ha. in 2000s though 

it had registered some increase during the 

mid 60s and 70s.  The main challenges faced 


deterioration in soil health due to depletion 
of top soil and decline in organic content, 

marginalization of landholdings, dwindling 

ground water resources, shortage of labour 

force, declining cropping intensity and poor 

adoption of crop management practices.  The 
Twelfth Five Year Plan will make efforts to 

address these issues by bringing back the 
fallow lands under cultivation of oilseeds, 

pulses and millets.Review of the Eleventh Five Year 
Plan PerformanceMany initiatives were undertaken during the Eleventh Five Year Plan apart from implementing various schemes.  As 
against the outlay of 
`2885.90 crore for Crop 

Husbandry sector, an amount of 
`3063.04 crore was spent (106 percent). The actual 
expenditure is much more under Government 

of India and World Bank projects.  The 

expenditure is higher than the outlay due to 
the implementation of National Agricultural 
Development Programme (NADP), National 

Food Security Mission (NFSM), Integrated 

Scheme for Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil palm and 

Maize (ISOPOM), Crop Insurance Schemes, 

Seeds Multiplication Scheme of paddy, 

millets, pulses, oilseeds and cotton and 

World Bank assisted Tamil Nadu Irrigated 

Agriculture Modernization and Waterbodies 

Restoration and Management Project (TN 

IAMWARM) etc.For effective delivery of quality 
inputs and extension services, additional 

initiatives such as establishment of 18 Seed 

Testing Laboratories, nine new Bio Fertilizer 

Production Labs in addition to six existing 

units, 11 Soil Testing Laboratories, Agri Clinic 

cum Mini Soil Testing Laboratories at one per

Rice 
Rice is the staple food occupying 33 percent of the gross area sown.  Of the total 
rice area, 93 percent is irrigated and balance 

is under rainfed lands mostly under semi-

increased from 66.11 L.MT (2006-07) to 75.96 
(2011-12) L.MT.  Due to natural calamities, 
rice production in the State was around 

50-52 L.MT during initial years of the Plan.  

Productivity of rice increased from 3423 kg/

ha (2006-07) to 3746 kg/ha. (2011-12). Technical Intervention for Rice 
Production In Tamil Nadu, System of Rice 

introduced in a big way in the year 2007-
08 and efforts were taken to popularize the 

technology and for its adoption over a larger 

area.  In the year 2007-08, 4.21 L.ha. paddy 

area was brought under SRI out of total 

paddy area of 17.89 L.ha. which was only 24 
percent.  Productivity achievement under SRI 

was 4051 kg/ha. increase of 66 percent over 
the conventional method.  With the objective 

of increasing rice production in districts 

wherein potential exists to expand area and 

increase productivity, National Food Security 

Mission (NFSM) is being implemented in 

Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Pudukottai, 

Ramanathapuram and Sivagangai districts.  

Implementation of Seed Multiplication /Seed 

Village schemes has resulted in increased 

seed replacement rate to 68 percent against 


of India.MilletsThe main reasons for drastic 
reduction of area under millets over the 



wheat, less returns to farmers, absence of 

added economic value based food items, 

changing lifestyle of the people, mismatch 

between minimum support price and cost 

of cultivation, less area under irrigation and 

cultivation of local varieties.Millets occupy 11 percent of the 
gross area sown and the major millets 
cultivated are Cholam, Cumbu, Maize and 

Ragi.  Normal area under millets is 7.07 L.ha 

and production is 15.57 L.MT. Technical 

interventions such as adoption of millet based 
cropping system, use of hybrids, precision 

farming and implementation of schemes 

such as procurement and distribution of 

millet seeds, ISOPOM-Maize, NADP and 

Seed Village scheme brought in substantial 

improvement in productivity and production. 



production from 13.62 L.MT to 24.31 L.MT 
and productivity enhanced from 1950 kg/

ha to 3022 kg/ha. during the Eleventh 

Five Year Plan period. Maize, being a highly 

remunerative crop also paved the way for 
shift in cropping pattern and increase in area 
under millets. Area under maize registered an 

increase from 1.97 to 3.44 L.ha. production 
increased from 7.59 to 17.81 L.MT and yield 

increased from 3888 to 5176 kg/ha. during 

the Eleventh Five Year Plan period.  Pulses Pulses occupy nearly 11 percent of 
the gross area sown in the state of which 
only 8.73 percent is irrigated.  Normal area 

under pulses is 5.80 L.ha and the normal 
production is 2.24 L.MT. With an objective of 

increasing the production and productivity of 

pulses and bridging the demand Œ supply gap, 
pulses were promoted as pure crop under 

irrigated condition on cluster basis. Suitable 

strategies were adopted in rice fallow pulses 

and rainfed areas under NFSM.  Similarly, 
foliar spraying of 2 percent DAP from 2007-08, 



2010-11 under NADP and implementation 

of Accelerated Pulses Production Programme 

(A3P) from 2010-11 with an objective to 

bring a compact area of 1000 hectares per 
unit purely under pulses helped the State to 

increase pulses production.Food grains 
The area and production of food 
grains registered an increase from 31.66 L.ha 

to 37.16 L.ha and 82.64 L.MT to 103.85 L.MT 
respectively during the Eleventh Five Year 



programmes such as NFSM, A3P and NADP 
led to considerable increase in the area and 
production of food grains. 46Cotton 
Cotton occupies nearly 2 percent 
of the gross area sown.  The normal area 
under cotton is 1.09 L.ha. with a production 

of 2.24 lakh bales (170 kg lint each).  With 

an objective to increase the production 

and productivity of cotton, schemes viz., 

procurement and distribution of cotton seeds, 

Technology Mini Mission-II for cotton, NADP 

and increasing production of cotton using 

growth promoter-Naphthalene Acetic Acid 
(NAA), TNAU cotton plus and micronutrient 

mixture were implemented in the State. 

The major technological interventions like 
adoption of precision farming, micro irrigation 

systems such as drip and sprinklers at 
subsidized cost motivated cotton growers to 

take up cultivation extensively. The area and 
production increased from 1.00 L.ha to 1.45 
L.ha. and from 2.21 L.bales to 3.78 L.bales 
respectively during the Eleventh Five Year 

Plan period. Sugarcane 
Sugarcane is a major irrigated crop of 
the State next to rice which plays a vital role 

in the State™s economy.  It is a high water 

and labour intensive crop occupying 5.5 

percent of the gross area sown. The normal 

area, production and productivity of the crop 
is 3.38 L. ha. 375.23 L.MT and 108 MT (cane) 
per ha respectively.  In the year 2011-12, the 

area, production and productivity were 3.82 

L. ha. 393.67 L. MT and 108 MT (cane) per 

ha. respectively.Oilseeds 

productivity of oilseeds in the country.  

Oilseeds occupy 7.7 percent of the gross area 

sown.  Major oilseeds grown in Tamil Nadu are 


The normal area under oilseeds was 5.56 

L.ha. of which groundnut occupies 4.75 L.ha. 

The normal production of oilseeds is 11.13 

L.MT. Normal production and productivity of 

groundnut are 9.93 L.MT and 2323 kg per 
 ha. respectively.During 2007-08, almost all the 
districts witnessed low productivity and the 

State recorded 1747 kg per ha. from an area 

of 6.59 L.ha. resulting in production of 11.52 
L.MT.  In the succeeding years, even though 

the area declined substantially, productivity 

in most of the districts was found to be higher 

with reference to the State average.  During 

the Eleventh Five Year Plan, components 

such as procurement and distribution of 

quality seeds, combined nutrient spray 

under ISOPOM, micro irrigation and gypsum 

distribution for groundnut under NADP 



were recorded. There was a 48 percent yield 

increase with water saving to an extent 
of 30-40 percent and higher oil content 

was recorded under precision farming.  

Factors attributed for steady increase in the 


seeds, b) promotion of micro irrigation in a 

larger extent, c) encouragement of farmers 

by the adoption of seed village scheme and 

d) Integrated Nutrient and Pest Management

Five Year Plan.  In case of Blue Green Algae 
4949(BGA), as against the target of 2.65 L.MT 
only 1.57 L.MT have been produced and 
distributed to the farmers during the same 
period.  Per hectare consumption of fertilizer 
in the state has increased from 40 kg per 
ha in 1970-71 to 194 kg per ha. in 2007-08 
(nearly 5 fold increase).   The Government of 
India has announced the policy of grant on 

Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) and in this 

context, awareness creation on the use of 
need based optimal application of fertilizers 

and Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) is 

a must and needs to be scaled up.    Pesticides Nearly 20 percent production loss has been estimated due to pests and 
disease incidence and to prevent such 

loss, a perfect monitoring is essential. 

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is being 

popularized extensively.  By this, the State™s 
consumption of technical grade pesticides 

which was 10,926 MT during 1984-85 has 
now been brought down to 2,335 MT.  Apart 
from this, the use of bio-pesticides and bio 

control agents were encouraged. Localized 

production of these bio-pesticides needs to 

be encouraged and support facilities to be 



technical knowledge transfers. Agricultural Mechanisation            At present (2011-12), 94 bull 
dozers, 165 tractors, 31 combine harvesters 
and 2 hydraulic excavators are hired out to 

farmers through the Agricultural Engineering 

Department (AED).  The available machinery 

in the AED is not adequate to meet the 

requirement of the farmers. During the 

Eleventh Five Year Plan under NADP, 50 
percent subsidy assistance to the tune 

of `162.20 crore was given to farmers 
for promotion of agricultural machinery 

and 7807 power tillers, 3414 rotovators, 

987 paddy transplanters, 765 paddy 

combine harvesters and 48,144 numbers of 

agricultural machinery / implements were 

procured.  Also, under the centrally sponsored 


Mode Programme, agricultural machinery/ 
implements were popularized among the 

farming community so as to supplement the 

available farm power, to meet out shortage of 
agricultural labourers, to ensure timeliness 

in carrying out various farm operations and 
to increase agricultural production.  Subsidy 

assistance was given to farmers to the tune 
of `38.15 crore which includes the State 
share of `3.81 crore to procure 1072 tractors, 
7730 power tillers, 1535 rotovators and 572 

agricultural implements.Scheme for Replacing Old Pumpsets 
with New Efficient Pumpsets
pumpsets is poor as the farmers are using 

poor discharge compared to their rated 

horsepower. In order to overcome these 

setbacks and with an aim to save electricity, 

subsidy assistance was provided to farmers 

for replacing their old pumpsets and 

renewal of electrical accessories. During the 

Eleventh Five Year Plan, this programme was 

implemented to replace 45778 old pumpsets

Revitalizing Agriculture 
Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 envisages that 
infrastructure development in agriculture are 

a) improving the productivity in agriculture, 

b) assurance of year round irrigation and 

c) marketing extension. With this in view, 
the Twelfth Five Year Plan has focused on 
strategies to achieve an AAGR of 5.0 percent 

in agriculture and allied sector. The hiatus in agriculture is mainly 
due to deteriorating soil health, declining 

water resources, inadequate investment in 

rural infrastructure, inadequate research 50& development activities and spiraling 
prices of inputs, change in the mindsets of 

people viewing agriculture as of low value.  

To break this hiatus, the government is 
actively formulating farmer/farm oriented, 



with adequate investment in developing 

rural infrastructure to augment agricultural 
production.Farmers are motivated to adopt 
professional approach in agriculture by 

measures such as bringing fallow lands 

under cultivation, adoption of two-pronged 

approach to obtain high productivity by 

identifying districts having large cropped area 

but less productivity and districts having 

high productivity but less cropped area,

Union Planning Commission highlights the 

decline in net area sown due to diversion 

of agricultural lands for urbanization and

suggested that reasonable restrictions on 

acquisition of multi-crop irrigated land should 

be laid and wherever net area sown is less 
than 50 percent of total geographical area, 

the State concerned should necessarily set 

a cap on cultivable area to be acquired. The

New Interventions: System of Rice Intensification (SRI) 
Technology as a village conceptIn spite of introduction of SRI 
four years ago, yield gap still exists due to 
non-adoption of all critical technological 

components and this necessitates the 

promotion of SRI as a village concept. Under 

this concept, rice growing villages will be 

selected and promoted on cluster basis to 
ensure perfect adoption of the technology. 

This scheme will be implemented with the 

creation of community nursery; pooling 
and timely provision of resources / inputs 

such as water, seeds, fertilizers including 

bio-fertilizers, plant protection chemicals, 

machinery, etc; conduct of demonstration 


place, convincing the laggards of the same 
village and motivating the farmers of nearby 

villages; minimizing cost of cultivation by 

optimal and localized need based timely 

management of resources to augment 





locations will be attempted. The Government has announced 
prize money and a medal worth `3500 to 
encourage paddy cultivation using SRI 

technology.  Farmers who have cultivated 

paddy in minimum 50 cents of land and 
achieved a yield of more than 2500 kg of 

paddy in an acre are eligible to participate in 

the SRI yield contest.   5555System of Rice Intensification - SuitabilitySynergy of the recommended twelve 
critical steps of SRI, when adopted in toto, 
would lead to considerable increase in rice 

yield. In SRI, alternate wetting and drying is 

an important step to ensure root aeration. 
SRI should not be adopted where soil and 
water conditions are not suitable like low 

lying areas. While SRI adoption has been 

given more emphasis in the Twelfth Plan 
striving to achieve the target of 16.50 L. ha, 

care has to be taken to spread the SRI in the 
suitable areas only. Millets Mission 
In the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it is 
proposed to introduce an Integrated Millets 

Mission through a convergent approach 

by involving Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Civil Supplies and Consumers™ 

Protection as well as Department of 

Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business.   

Farmers all over the State will greatly be

study in Tamil Nadu has revealed equal or 

higher incidence of diabetes. This needs 

immediate attention. Introducing millets

ancestral period could resolve this anomaly. 



are way ahead of rice and wheat in terms 
of nutritional content. For instance, millets 

contain 10.6 grams of protein per kilogram, 

as against rice which contains only 6.8 grams.          56
grams to 10.1 grams), minerals (1.9 grams to 

4.4 grams) and calcium (31 mg to 344 mg) in 
comparison to rice. Millets are crops that can 

survive adverse climate change conditions. 

It has been shown that millets can grow in 

conditions of low rainfall requiring as little 

as 300 to 350 mm depending on the type of 

millet and in poor and heavily degraded soils, 

which are the characteristic traits of the arid 
and semi-arid regions of the State. All these 

characteristics make millets the ideal crop for 

the climate crisis that is looming ahead of our 

State. Twelfth Five Year Plan Strategy for

value added foods in the ready-to-eat and 

ready-to-cook form is the need of the hour.  For 
this, establishment of business incubators is 

essential. Business incubators for processing 

of millets and production of millet based 

value added products will be established 

by entrepreneurs.  These incubators 

help to upscale processing methods for 

development of traditional foods, production

large proportions of husk and bran which 

requires de-husking and de-braning prior 

to consumption.  Despite their nutritional 

superiority, utilization of millets is restricted 



millets in ready-to-eat form.  Hence, millets 





processing units are essential to increase 

the availability of millets in the ready-to-use 

form.  Financial assistance for establishment 

of modern millets based processing units and 

modernization of existing millet processing 

units to increase the recovery percentage 

are the required strategies to achieve the 

objectives.  The proposed Millets Mission 

would extend such necessary assistance 

through Department of Agricultural 

Marketing and Agri Business.Distribution of Millets through PDS. 
Millets are also consumed by a certain 
percentage of high end consumers.  A study on preference of food grains indicated that 
consumers may be willing to increase the 

offtake of millets through PDS if it is made 

available at the outlets.  Hence, through the 
Millets Mission, it is suggested to provide 

three kg of any one of the available millets 
to all family card holders.  The family card 

holders eligible for rice could be provided with 
three kg of millets per month if requested 

at no additional cost.  The other category 

of family card holders will be provided with 

three kg of millets at subsidized rate. The 

total requirement of millets for 1.97 crore 

family card holders will be 59,100 tonnes/

the Coconut Development Board (CDB). For 

this purpose, an extent of 82.66 acres of land 
will be earmarked to the Board. Besides, steps 

will be taken for increasing the production of 

Dwarf x Tall Hybrid and Dwarf variety coconut 

seedlings in the State Coconut Nurseries and 

for improving the infrastructure facilities in 

those farms.Soil and Water Management 
ApproachesDuring the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it is 
proposed to take up detailed soil survey with 
the objective of identifying saline and alkaline 

soils and to reclamation of the problem soils. 

It is also proposed to take efforts to develop 

irrigation sources such as farm ponds, 

check dams, percolation ponds, etc., to meet 

the irrigation water requirement of rainfed 

crops at critical stage, for which funds 

under various schemes viz., A3P, Initiatives 

for Nutritional Security through Intensive 
Millets Promotion (INSIMP) and Rainfed 

Area Development Programme (RADP) will 
be dovetailed. (Detailed proposals on soil 

management are dealt in the sub chapter viz., 
3.2. Soil and Water Conservation including 

Rainfed Farming) Precision FarmingPrecision farming is an innovative 
method in which all the cultivation protocols 

are undertaken very accurately. Key steps 

viz., chisel ploughing, transplanting of 

young seedling, adopting recommended 
spacing, installing drip and micro irrigation 
and timely application of critical inputs are 

followed.   Upon success of the programme 

and unprecedented level of acceptance of the 

technology by the farmers, the programme

project to cover 1 lakh ha. under precision 
farming during the Twelfth Five Year Plan 
period.  Further it is also proposed to form 

precision vegetable clusters with market 

tie up or direct marketing by farmers by 
incorporating producers companies.National Mission on Micro 
Irrigation (NMMI)The conventional method of irrigation 
requires more water leading to wastage.  The 
use of micro irrigation systems like drip, 



of surface as well as ground water resources.  

Each drop of water is made productive in this 

technology. Uniform crop growth and produce 

size are achieved through this method.  Using 

micro irrigation, more area can be brought 

under cultivation with less water.  NMMI 

is a centrally sponsored scheme,  in which  

100 percent subsidy is given to small and 

marginal farmers (50 percent by Centre and 

50 percent by State) and 75 percent (40 
percent by Centre and 35 percent by State) 
to other category farmers for installation of 

drip, sprinkler and raingun systems for all 
horticulture crops and agriculture crops 

like sugarcane, coconut, cotton, maize, 

groundnut and pulses.  This scheme is being 

implemented only through registered and 



Twelfth Five Year Plan period, it is proposed 

cover an area of 3.10 lakh ha. under micro 

irrigation (1.86 L.ha. under horticulture 

crops and 1.24 L.ha under agriculture crops).Micro Irrigation Model VillagesTo give a big push to extend the 
area coverage under micro irrigation, a 

model village in each district will be set up 

to demonstrate the advantages of micro 

irrigation.  It is also proposed to provide micro 

irrigation equipments at subsidised cost and 
impart training to the farmers.6161Approach and Strategies for

Crops through Participatory 
ApproachWith the advent of hybrid technology, 
the farmers are required to replenish seeds 
every season from external sources such 

as research institutions, public and private 

sector seed producers to harness hybrid 

vigour. This has increased the productivity 



increased farmers™ dependence on external 
agencies. As a result, the informal and 

decentralized village seed industry has now 

been replaced by highly centralized seed 

market. However, it is almost impossible for 
the organized sector to meet farmers demand 
for the seed, considering the number of crops and varieties cultivated across the country.  

In this back drop, the concept of ‚seed village™ 



production and distribution of quality seeds, 

is fast gaining momentum. Seed villages 

or village seed banks operate with utmost 

transparency, mutual trust and social 
responsibility of the seed producing farmers 

towards seed using fellow farmers and under 

peer supervision. The establishment of village 

seed banks not only ensure good quality 
seeds for enhancing productivity, but also 

help in generating income for the community 
members resulting in improved livelihoods. It 

is proposed to form 7000 Commodity Interest 

Groups, 5000 village seed banks and to train 

1.25 lakh farmers.  6363Seed Certification

distribute liquid bio-fertilizers which have 

advantages such as longer shelf life of 12 

to 14 months, free of contamination, higher 
microbial population, cost effective and easy 

to use  Referral Laboratories for Complete 
Soil AnalysisThe era of indiscriminate use of NPK is 
over and due to dwindling supply of organics to soil, the soil organic carbon, humus and 
microbial load have come down considerably 

and the soil has also lost the micronutrient 

replenishing capacity in locations where 
two crops in a year or crops like turmeric, 

tapioca, banana, sugarcane are cultivated. 

Hence, external application of micronutrients 
for every crop and every season has become 

compulsory. The foliar application is only 

supplementary while the soil requires 

regular application. The existing soil testing 

laboratories have the facility to analyze NPK, 

micronutrients, Electrical Conductivity (EC), 

pH etc.The proposed referral laboratory for 
complete soil analysis lends support to the 

farmer by providing micronutrient analytical 

information for better productivity of crops. 

The complete soil analysis includes the 

estimation of micro organism status of the 
soil. One such common facility for the state 

with capacity to handle 1000 samples a day 

shall serve the purpose. The approximate 

outlay proposed is   `5.00 crore.Efficiency in Use of Chemical 
FertilizersTamil Nadu is adopting a multipronged 
strategy to maintain soil health and fertility 
status of the soil by the balanced application 

of inorganic and organic fertilizers. Schemes 

such as balanced and integrated use of 

fertilizers, production and distribution of 

bio-fertilizers, procurement and distribution 

of green manure seeds, vermi-composting of 

farm waste, composting of farm wastes with

farmers, the Tamil Nadu Government has 
exempted 4 percent Value Added Tax (VAT)

led to change in policy and research. Tamil 

Nadu is particularly attentive to increased 

adoption of this productivity enhancing, 

cost-effective and eco-friendly production 

practices.The increased use of pesticides has 
disturbing consequences on the farming 

system, particularly, due to the development 

of resistance, resurgence of insect pests and 
decline in population of the natural enemies 

of pests.  Over-use of pesticides may lead 

to serious repercussion on environment 

and ecology. Hence, it is imperative to step 

up investment in research and technology,

low income generating crops to high value 
horticulture crops. The overall production 

and productivity of the horticulture crops 

will be doubled during the Twelfth Five Year 

Plan period.  Horticultural Parks for fruits, 

vegetables and spices would be developed 

across the state.  More thrust will be given 

to micro irrigation with fertigation, precision 

farming, hi-density planting and organic 

cultivation by which large area will be 

covered under horticulture crops thereby the 

productivity per drop of water integrated crop 

management, post harvest management and 

market linkages and per unit area will be 

enhanced.6565Urban Organic Cultivation 
Increase in personal disposable income and awareness on food safety among urban dwellers have opened the gates for 
urban organic cultivation of vegetables.  The 
consumers are getting the information on 

harmfulness of pesticides on human health 

and their entry into food chain through 

effective media and internet. Kitchen 

gardening and terrace gardening are handy 

tools that could satisfy the vegetable needs 
of most of the nuclear families of the urban 

centres.  Besides the above, these gardens 

act as potential stress reducers.  Models of 
kitchen gardening and terrace gardening 

to suit the urban consumers are already 

available with TNAU and matching the 

requirements of consumers is the only need. 

Hence, in the Twelfth Five Year Plan, it has 

been proposed to convert the awareness into 
actual kitchen and terrace garden models 

through capacity building programmes.  

The IEC funds available in the existing 
horticultural programmes will be utilized.   Popularising of Banana Cultivation

capacity at an investment of `20.00 crore. 

This has opened up the avenue of exporting 

to Dubai when they are competing with

given exposure visits to Theni to emulate 

similar successful models in their locality.  

Also, capacity building programmes will

pumps. With availability of better paying 

service sector and construction jobs, 

increased migration from agriculture to other 
sectors is observed in Tamil Nadu during 
the last decade. To increase the productivity 

of the land and to cope up with shrinking 

agricultural manpower, mechanisation is 
not only essential but also imperative. The 

constraints in promotion of mechanisation 

include non standardized agricultural 
practices, small and marginal land holdings, 

low investment capacity of farmers, lack of 

know-how and non availability of service 

and maintenance facilities. Policy and 

structural mechanisms shall be developed to 

address these issues and support increased 

mechanisation in all phases of agriculture

in every PACCSIt is proposed to establish an agro 
service unit in every Primary Agricultural 
Cooperative Credit Society (PACCS) in the 

State for providing necessary agricultural 

machinery/implements to the farmers on hire 

basis. As the farmers do not have adequate 

knowledge to operate and maintain the 

agricultural machinery, it is also proposed to 

form farmers group in the jurisdiction of every 
PACCS to render necessary service support 

to the farmers in that area on various aspects 

of operation, repair and maintenance of 

various agricultural machinery/implements. 

This farmers group will also take part in the 

activities like raising of seedlings, custom 

hiring, supply of machinery and labour for 

various agricultural operations in that area. 

In Tamil Nadu, 4534 numbers of PACCS 

are functioning. It is proposed to continue 

the programme of providing agricultural 
machinery/implements to 3500 PACCS.
Mode Approach to increase the pace of 
agricultural mechanisation in the State and 



& water resources techniques for sustainable 

agriculture in rainfed areas. Crop varieties 
will be selected to suit the mechanization and 

facilitation for easy movement of machinery 

by adopting planned planting. Online Booking of Farm Machinery Presently, the farmer has to approach 
in person for booking the farm machinery in 
AED which drains time and money.  Hence, 
the Department of Agriculture has planned 

to provide an online booking system of farm 

machinery through the existing AGRISNET 

web portal.  With this system, the farmers 

can plan well ahead about the requirement of 

farm machinery and book it online through 

telephone and can make payment online 

through a payment gateway. This would help 

the farmers, to save time and money.SF and MF Friendly Machinery 
Average farm size in Tamil Nadu is 0.80 ha and it is declining year after year.  
The intensity of marginalization of holdings 

gets aggravated due to increase in population, 
subdivision and fragmentation.  On the 

other hand, increasing labour shortage in 

agriculture has resulted in dependence of 

machinery.  Owing to the size of holdings, the 
capacity utilization of the machinery is not 

achieved in most of the farms as the existing 
machinery are designed for larger farm size.  

Increased availability of machinery in villages 

has reduced the potential revenue generation 

through custom hiring.  In this context, usage 

of these machinery that are in vogue in small 
farms of Korea and Japan would be a viable 

alternative.  Small size of these machinery 

demand relatively lesser initial capital and 

can be utilized fully in the small holdings.  

Hence, in the Twelfth Five Year Plan it has 

been proposed to popularize these small 

and marginal farmer friendly machinery.  In 
addition to this, plant breeders should give 

emphasis on developing varieties which 

facilitate the use of these types of machinery.
Crop Insurance - National 
Agricultural Insurance Scheme 

(NAIS)The State Government is making 

Insurance Schemes by introducing interim 
compensation to insured farmers, reducing 

the insurance unit area to revenue village level, 

uniform seasonality discipline, on account 

payment of claims for timely disbursement, 



to take risks in agriculture and protect them 
at the time of distress.The NAIS, since its inception has 
reached the pinnacle as of now in enrolling the 
farmers, area insured and premium subsidy.  

Initially, the farmers especially non-loanee 

farmers were reluctant to enroll under this 

scheme.  However, extension of 50 percent 

premium subsidy to both loanee and non-

loanee farmers brought higher percentage of

pilot basis in selected blocks by removing 
the bottlenecks in the existing NAIS and

Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS)The critical stages of a crop such as 

stages are insured for weather parameters like 


humidity, consecutive dry days, wind speed, 

etc.  Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) have 

been established in 224 blocks and linked with 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University website 
to provide medium range weather forecast to 
carry out agriculture related activities by the 

farmers in time and also to provide weather 

data to the insurance companies. TNAU was

with a production of 55,471 lakh nuts and 
productivity of 13,852 nuts/ha. and there 

are better prospects to bring more area 

and increase the production besides value 

addition.  Coconut cultivation is largely 

affected by natural calamities.  In view of 

this, CPIS has been introduced on pilot basis 
in 11 districts with the objective to provide 

insurance coverage against natural and other 

perils, provide relief against income loss, 

minimize risks and encourage replanting.  

Healthy nut bearing coconut palms grown as 
mono or intercrop, on bunds or homestead 

and all varieties of coconut (Tall varieties of 

7 to 60 years and Dwarf and hybrids of 4 to 

60 years) are insured.  Individual farmers/
growers cultivating atleast 10 healthy nut 

bearing palms are eligible for enrolment.  The

 ‚Uzhavar Peruvizha™ is a village 
level mass contact programme in Campaign 
Mode and it has been conducted for effective 

dissemination of information to help farmers 

to take rational decisions about various 

activities in agriculture and allied  sectors. 

This campaign was organized at the village 
level in all 16,564 revenue villages to enable 

the farmers to take on the challenges posed 
by today™s  agriculture and gear them up 

to be a part of Second Green Revolution in 
the State. This campaign was conducted 
70through ‚Mobile Extension Centre Approach™ 


agriculture and allied sectors and other 

stakeholders like input suppliers, bankers. 

All the stake holders spent one whole day 

with farmers to disseminate information 
and technologies. Integrated Farming 
System is being popularized during the 

mass contact programme. The information 

was disseminated through Street theatres, 
folk dance, songs, workshop with focus on 

the local farm problems and appropriate 

solutions. Various demonstrations, Mini 

Exhibition, discussion, Audio Visual shows, 

Mini cattle health camps were also conducted. 

Besides, farmers™ baseline data, soil testing, 

feed back on Government Farmers™ Integrated 

Handbooks and Farmers Guide Books were 

also distributed to the farmers. Based on the 
success of Uzhavar Peruvizha, it is proposed 

to conduct mass campaign every year to serve 
the farmers at their door steps.Gender - Empowerment of Women 
FarmersThe Government of Tamil Nadu has 
taken the following special initiatives in the 
Twelfth Five Year Plan to motivate women 



tune of 30 percent to 33 percent extended 

under various crop oriented schemes, 
 b) empowerment of farm women through 

capacity building on decision-making in the 

context of farm management, seed production 

and marketing, agricultural marketing with 
respect to post-harvest management, value 
addition of agricultural produce and market 
requirements/demand and c) Empowering 

farm women groups by distribution of gender 
friendly farm equipments, farm machinery 

for their use and hiring.  Farm women are 

motivated to form Farm Women groups and 



business and encourage farm women form 

commodity groups under ATMA. Box 3.1.6: Shift towards High

and marginal farmers.Innovative Schemes for Upliftment 
of Scheduled Caste / Scheduled 

Tribe FarmersThe proactive policy interventions of the Government of India and the State    
Government are to improve the socio-

economic status of the scheduled caste 

farmers for which the governments are 



oriented schemes in proportion to scheduled 

caste™s population in the State which now 
stands at 19 percent. In order to improve the 
economic status and to ensure transparency 
in implementing schemes exclusively for SC/

ST farmers, following schemes are proposed 

in the Twelfth Five Year Plan.Purchase of Wetlands for SC/ST 
FarmersWetlands are of major importance 
in agricultural systems and are becoming 
even more valuable components of agro-

ecosystems. The general understanding was 

that SCs do not own contiguous areas and 
that their holdings are scattered in the midst 

of land held by others. It may be observed 

that nearly two-thirds of the SCs and over 80 

percent of the STs are engaged in agricultural 
activities. On the other hand, only about 

53 percent of the ‚Others™ are involved in 
these activities. By and large, the SC & 

ST population depend on rain water and 
natural water resources for cultivating their 



existing irrigational facilities as available to 

other agricultural communities.  Under this 

backdrop, it is imperative to provide wetlands 

to SC/ST farmers as it will be one of the viable 

livelihood to uplift the economic status of the 

farmers.  The scheme may be implemented 

by the Revenue Department.Apart from the above, a separate 
provision of outlay in case of IFS, 
multiplication and distribution of seeds, 

distribution of inputs especially tractor and 

machinery, establishment of food processing 

units, cold storage units and coverage of 
crop/weather insurance scheme and other 

welfare schemes.

Agricultural GrowthThe Twelfth Five Year Plan has 
propounded the unique concept of Farm 
Level Planning which views the constraints in 
agriculture holistically and suggests practical 

solutions on individual farm unit basis and 

thereby contemplates to bring the desired 

increase in farm production.  Strengthening 

research and extension services to all 

farm families in Tamil Nadu-Farm level 

interventions for ﬁend-to-endﬂ involvement 
of extension staff with individual farmer has 

been planned. The Twelfth Five Year Plan 





(SRI) and SRI villages, improved pulses 

production technologies viz., System of Pulses 



Sustainable Sugarcane Initiatives (SSI) and 

Precision Farming to bridge the yield gap.  

Also, strategies are designed for improving 

agricultural marketing infrastructure and 

promoting farmers™ participation in agri-
business ventures. The Twelfth Five Year 

Plan has also framed strategies to increase 
the cultivable area and diversifying the 

cultivation in favour of high value horticulture 
and commercial crops while ensuring the food 

and nutritional security is ensured through 

the proposed Millet Mission. The requirement 
of agricultural inputs by the farmers will 
be assessed through ISMS by conducting 

meetings at village panchayat level and 

bottom up planning will be given priority 

so as to meet the local needs effectively 
and strategies are designed for ensuring 

the timely availability of adequate quantity 

of inputs. Apart from the above Integrated 

Farming System will be popularized so as to 

increase the farm income. Gender inclusive 

approach is given much focus and there 



equipments such as power weeders and 

markers. Adequate focus is bestowed on 

soil health improvement and reclamation 

of saline and alkaline soil, issue of Farmers

The Twelfth Five Year Plan includes strategies 

for need based human development through 

establishment of district poly-technics. The 

plan also proposes decentralized planning in 

the rural sector and linking it to the urban 

markets, and revitalizing the villages leading 

to the retention of the rural population in 
agriculture and allied sectors.  An amount of `7922.80 crore has been proposed in the Twelfth Five Year Plan
