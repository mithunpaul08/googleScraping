Preface
 
 
 
Tamil Nadu
,
 
one of the major
 
state
s
 
of India
,
 
is endowed with 
diverse 
soil and weather conditions comprising of
 
several agro
-
climatic condition
s that 
help
 
the state to adopt a diversified cropping pattern. 
The state has a 
substantial
 
area under vege
table crops. It is also having 
the largest herd of 
livestock amongst 
Indian states
.
 
T
he state faces many challenges that are to 
be addressed systematically so as to facilitate a 
sustainable
 
development of 
the State
. In order to understand the prevailing impediments and challenges 
to agricultural growth in various states, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Government
 
of India proposed to carry out state specific report
s focusing on 
agricultural
 
scenario
 
and the task was
 
as
signed to various AERCs/Units 
located 
in
 
different states in India. The Agro
-
Economic Research Centre, 
University of Madras was entrusted 
with the responsibility of preparing
 
a 
report on agricultural scenario in the state of Tamil Nadu. The framework of 
th
e report was given by the Ministry. 
 
 
This report presents the state of agriculture in Tamil Nadu by using 
secondary data collected from various published sources. The present study 
evaluates the performance of agriculture
 
in the state of Tamil Nadu in the
 
recent years and also presents what could be the future options, given our 
objectives of accelerated growth, inclusiveness and reduction of poverty.
 
I 
wish to
 
thank the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India for the unstinted 
cooperation and support
. It is hoped that this study will be useful to 
agricultural scientists, economists, non
-
governmental organizations, policy 
makers and planners in understa
nd
ing the present state of agricultur
al
 
sector 
in Tamil Nadu.

Introduction
 
1. Tamil Nadu 
 
Tamil Nadu is
 
one of the well developed states. It is the second largest 
state in economic activity after Maharashtra and the fifth largest contributor to 

economy, the share of the Service se
ctor in the state is increasing along with 
the falling share of Agriculture sector. It is
 
geographically located between 8°5' 

result of this geographical p
osition, Tamil Nadu enjo
ys semi
-
arid climate, which 
permits higher crop productivity under irrigation.
 
 
Tamil Nadu is
 
located in the extreme south of the subcontinent. It is 
bounded by the Indian Ocean to the east and south and by the state of 
Kerala to the west, Karnataka to the
 
northwest, and Andhra Pradesh to the 
north. The capital is Chennai (Madras) on the coast in the northeastern 
portion of the state. Tamil Nadu is the eleventh largest state in India by area 
and the seventh most populous state. It is the second largest stat
e economy 
in India as of 2012. 
But, in the case of the agricultural sector 
Tamil Nadu is 
one of th
e water starved states in India;
 
it is endowed with only 3% of water 
resource
s
 
in India. 
The profile of agricultural sector in 
Tamil Nadu
 
is mixed 
with much s
trength, some weaknesses, many opportunities and some 
threats. The following section examines such mixed trends in terms a 
SWOT analysis.   
 
1.1 Agricultural Sector
 
1.1.1 Strengths
 

 
The State possesses varied types of agro
-
climatic conditions ranging 
from 
hot tropical through sub
-
tropical to temperate climate.
 
 

 
The major types of soils like red, black, alluvial, loamy and sandy 
loam found in the State are highly suitable for growing a variety of 
crops.
 
 
10
 
 

 
A wide range of crops such as cereals, pulses, 
oilseeds, fruits, 
vegetables and other crops are cultivated under varied agro
-
climatic 
conditions and elevations in the State.
 
 

 
People in the State are industrious and hard
-
working and hence a 
science
-
 
based technological back
-
up can go a long way in impro
ving 
agricultural production.
 
 

 
Well
-
developed agri
-
based cotton textiles and sugar industries are 
the added strengths for the rapid growth of the economy.
 
 

 
The rail as well as road transport systems, which are essential for 
agricultural development, are we
ll 

 
knitted in the State
 
 

 
Both urban and rural electrification is close to 100 percent in the State 
and 
that acts as a catalyst for the growth of the State economy.
 
 

 
The long coastal length of 1,076 kms. and the widely spotted inland 
water bodies indicate
 
the high growth potential of fishery sector in the 
State; and
 
 

 
The livestock population is sizable in the State. There exists very 
good potential for boosting production of milk and sheep / goat / 
poultry meat in the State through scientific feeding, bree
ding and 
health management.
 
 
1.1.2 Weaknesses
 

 
The success of agriculture depends on the successful monsoons. 
Frequent monsoon failures, low and uncertain rainfall and its skewed 
distribution affect the tempo of agricultural growth.
 
 

 
Uneconomic size of a 
very large number of marginal and small farms, 
low economic status of the farmers and the low literacy level among 
farmers affect the full adoption of scientific farming and hence the 
agricultural production and
 
 

 
Many of the irrigation systems and structur
es are in dilapidated 
conditions for want of funds. The tanks and waterways are highly 
silted and filled with the
 
growth of bushes. Heavy seepage losses and 
hindrance to the free flow of water are found in conveying water 
through the irrigation canals from
 
dams, reservoirs and big tanks. 
Moreover, unauthorized encroachment of catchment and water 
spread areas of the irrigation tanks is a common phenomenon 
throughout the State. Improper up
-
keep of canal and river bunds 
11
 
 
results in recurring breaches and conseq
uent damages to the 
standing crops, livestock and human lives in the villages
,
 
especially 
during 
rainy seasons and flash floods
.
 
 
1.1.3 Opportunities
 

 
The rainfall pattern and its distribution provide scope for raising 
almost all field and horticultural cro
ps round the year in most pockets 
of the State. 
 
 

 
As urbanization and industrialization are on the ascent in the recent 
years, the market demand for quality agricultural products and 
protective foods like milk, fruits and vegetables is getting increased. 
This indicates the need for incentives for increasi
ng the yield per acre 
in field crops and in vegetables and fruits production etc., besides 
milk and meat production in the years to come. 
 
 

 
The demand for ready
-
to
-
cook as well as ready
-
to
-
eat foods is also 
increasing. Thus, there is ample opportunity for 
the agri
-
processing 
units to flourish, in the years to come in the State.
 
 

 
The red, black, alluvial and loamy soils found in the State are highly 
productive and their capabilities can be sustained through proper and 
planned soil fertility management practi
ces.
 
 

 
As the labour availability is becoming scarce, especially during peak 
agricultural operations like transplanting and harvesting, the farm 
mechanization is on the increase. However, the high investment 
requirement and non
-
affordability by the individu
al farmer, especially 
the marginal and small, give way for custom services and evolution of 
small agri
-
business entrepreneurs in the State.
 
 

 
Large extent of land (about 24 lakh hectares) is considered as waste 
land in the State. This provides opportunities
 
for land reclamation and 
development of horticulture and plantation crops in the State and 
acceptable adoption of Hi
-
Tech like precision farming.
 
 
1.1.4 
Threat
s
 

 
Low and skewed distribu
tion of rainfall and heavy down
pour in a f
ew 
days especially during 
north
east monsoon and consequent flash 
floods occurring often and inadequate infrastructure to control and 
store the flood water, dam
age
 
the st
anding crops heavily and affect
 
the production.
 
 
12
 
 

 
Price volatility with high fluctuations and non
-
remunerative 
prices of 
farm products and consequent non
-
profitability of the farm business. 
This could lead to farmers quitting the agricultural occupation itself, 
once for all.
 
 

 
The outbreak
 
of pests and diseases 
is
 
often recurring in certain 
endemic areas of the Stat
e. These pose the threat to the crops 
leading to complete loss to many farmers.
 

 
In the recent years, due to heavy pumping of ground
-
water 
especially in summer and early kharif seasons, the reversal of 
ground water flow results in sea
-
water intrusion in the
 
inlands along 
the coastal belt a
nd consequently making the bore
well as well as 
the open well
-
water, unfit for crop production and drinking. Many 
farmers in fact, abandoned the cultivation of especially the kharif 
crop, due to sea
-
water intrusion along the
 
coastal belt.
 
 

 
The inter
-
state disputes on the major irrigation systems like 
Cauvery, Mullai Periyar, Palar, etc. affect the agricultural growth of 
the State to a great degree and
 
 

 
Fast urbanization and industrialization and indiscriminate conversion 
of a
gricultural land to non
-
agricultural purposes, pose a great threat 
of contraction of
 
land put to agricultural uses and consequent 
reduction in production.

1.3 State Domestic Product and Per Capita Income
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the most socia
lly developed and economically 
progressive States in the country
. Its progress is evident
 
in terms of per 
capita income and Human Development Indicators (HDI).
 
Though the 
state has developed industrially, a
griculture still continues to be 
an 
important
 
sect
or and provides livelihood to nearly 45 percent of the 
people. But its share 
has come down sharply
 
to 8.0 percent of GSDP in 
2011
-
12 from 
20
 
percent in 
1997
-
98 (Figure 1.1)
. Global development 
experience reveals that one percent growth in agriculture is at
 
least two 
or three times more effective in reducing poverty than the type of same 
growth emanating from non
-
agricultural sector.

During the period 2000
-
 
11, this sector registered negative growth in 
five years and positive growth in six years and that shows the 
vulnerability of the sector and is also a cause of distress arising due to 
the instability in production and productivity. 
For instance, Table 1.3 
provides the growth rates of the three sectors for the last six years from 
16
 
 
2007
-
08 to 2012
-
13. In relations to industrial and services sector, the 
growth rate of agriculture is highly violated. Uncertain monsoon and 
irrigation is on
e of the major cause of this extreme volatility in the growth 
rates of this sector. 
A comprehensive package combining several 
components to 
stabilize
 
the sector should be designed to enhance the 
productivity 
of agriculture 
working within the 
severe 
water c
onstraints and 
by 
stabilizing or enabling inter
-
 
and intra
-
 
seasonal risk proofing of rain 
fed production systems.   
 
Diversification of agriculture into animal husbandry, non
-
food crops, 
horticulture, floriculture and sericulture has the potential to enha
nce the 
farm incomes. The food consumption basket is getting increasingly 
diversified and though cereal baskets dominate, this dominance is being 
eroded by rising expenditure on fruits, vegetables, milk, egg, meat and 

Commod
ities
, and this transformation, is in 
tune with development expectations. There are 13 coastal districts and 
591 fishing villages with a total marine fisher population of about 8.92 
lakh, of which 2.60 lakh fishermen are actively engaged in fishing
 
activit
ies
. Hence, it becomes imperative to enhance the incomes of the 
fisherfolk by augmenting marine and inland fish production through 
innovative technologies. The output from the agricultural sector should be 
reflected in higher rural incomes leading to impro
ved health and nutrition 
status. 
Enhancement of non
-
farming income 
such as post
-
harvest 
operations
, maintenance of farm equipment, 
and connecting expansion 
of farm activity to that of rura
l non
-
farm income opportunities
 
need more 
attention
.

Chapter

Growth of Agricultural Sector in Tamil Nadu:
 
Achievements and 
Challenges
 
 
 
This chapter discusses the various achievements of the agricultural 
sector in Tamil Nadu and 
the challenges the sector is facing. This is done 
in terms of some selected aspects like growth rates, its composition, 
structural changes taking place over a period of time etc.
 
 
(i) Agriculture in Tamil Nadu has enjoyed three decades of growth 
based larg
ely on rapid technological change. 
 
Food security has increased due to rapid increases in foodgrain output, 
sales from the Public Distribution System (supplied by Food Corporation of 
India stocks), targeted feeding and employment programs, and well
-
functio
ning rice markets that have enabled price
-
stabilizing inflows of rice 
from neighbouring states in years of local production shortfalls. Partly 
because of agricultural growth, rural poverty rates declined from 38.5 
percent to 24.3 percent between 1993/94 an

agriculture has a strong base for continued growth in terms of a strong 
agricultural research system, an extensive road network, and a relatively 
well
-
educated rural labor force.  
 
(ii) While agricultural sector growth rates in Tam
il Nadu were among 
the highest in India during the 1980s and early 1990s, deceleration in 
growth since the mid
-
1990s is of increasing concern to policymakers.

                                       
      
                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                             
      
                                                                                                       
 
During the 1980s
,
 
agricultural GSDP grew at 3.4 percent, exceeding 
the all
-
India agricultural growth of 2.9 percent. Adequate rainfall contributed 
to even higher growth in the early 1990s. Between 1989/90 and 1994/95, 
agriculture grew by 7.2 percent in Tamil Nadu, compared
 
with 3.1 percent in 
the whole of India. But between 1994/95 and 1999/2000, agriculture in Tamil 
Nadu suffered from severe consecutive droughts and grew only 1.3 percent 

19
 
 
agricultural
 
growth rate during the 1990s was only 2.9 percent a year, 
compared with 3.2
 
percent for all
-
India.  
 
(iii) Faster growth in agriculture is central to rural development and 
poverty reduction in Tamil Nadu. 
 
Although agriculture accounts for only 15.7 perce
nt of total GSDP, farm 
income accounts for about half of household income for 35 million people 

rural population is poor, with estimates ranging from 7.4 million people (20.6 
perc
ent of the rural population) to 11.4 million (31.8 percent of the rural 
population). For the poorest rural quintile (approximately 1.5 million 
households, or 7.5 million people), more than three
-
quarters of income is 
derived from agriculture, with agricult
ural wage labour alone accounting for 
half of household income. Given the importance of agriculture in the 
incomes of the poor in Tamil Nadu, growth in labour
-
intensive agriculture 
could further reduce rural poverty through higher yields to small producers
, 
higher real wages to agricultural labourers, and increased income and 
employment opportunities
 
with forward and backward linkages
 
to the rural 
nonfarm sector.   
 
(iv). Traditional sources of growth in agriculture face major constraints 
such as growing wa
ter scarcity, increasing land d
egradation, declining 
farm size
, and rising costs of labour. 
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the driest states in India, averaging only 925 

(January through May) 
even in good years, and severe droughts occur in 3
 
out
 
of 10 years, severely limiting cultivation of crops between June and 
September. Per capita availability of water resources in Tamil Nadu is only 
900 cubic metres a year, compared 
with 2,200 cubic metre
s for all
-
India. 
Irrigation through a combination of canals, wells, and tanks increases the 
reliability and availability of water for farming and is essential for cultivating 
crops in much of the state. But the seasonality and scarcity of supply limit 
cult
ivation to only one crop per plot for most of the state. The agricultural 
20
 
 
sector faces increasing competition for water from industry and domestic 
users and intensifying interstate competition for surface water resources. In 
many parts of the state, the ra
te of extraction of groundwater has exceeded 
recharge rates, contributing to falling water tables. Water quality is also a 
growing concern. Effluents discharged from industries and heavy use of 
pesticides and fertilizers have had a major impact on surface 
water quality, 
soils, and groundwater.   
 
(v) Agricultural land resources have also come under increasing 
pressure because of rapid population growth and urbanization. 
 
The growing pressures on land, skewed pricing policies, and rural 
poverty have all cont
ributed to land and soil degradation. As a result, poor 
soil fertility, salinity, water logging, overgrazing, and deforestation are 
growing problems and pose serious constraints to the performance of the 
agricultural sector in some parts of the state. 
 
(vi
) Seasonal labour shortages and rising real agricultural wages 
during the past two decades, in part caused by rapid rural
-
urban 
migration, have contributed to higher incomes for agricultural 
labou
r
ers, but make future agricultural growth more difficult by 

-
à
-
vis 
other agricultural producers. 
 
Higher labour costs, due in part to rapid growth in demand for 
nonagricultural labour, have increased the cost of cultivation, especially for 
labour
-
intensive
 
crops. In 1999

2000, rural wages for male agricultural 
labour in the kharif season in Tamil Nadu averaged Rs.62.2 a day, 
compared with only Rs.45.3 a day in Andhra Pradesh and Rs.42.8 in 
Karnataka. These higher labour costs encourage mechanized land 
prepa
ration and harvesting, but small farm sizes constrain the rate of 
mechanization. 
 
(vii) Given the constraints, diversification into higher value, less water
-
intensive products, such as fruits, vegetables, spices, and livestock 
products, may be one of the m
ost promising sources of agricultural 
growth. 
 
21
 
 

-
climatic conditions are well suited for diversified 
agriculture. Rapidly increasing incomes and changing patterns of food 
demand also provide strong impetus for diversification. Increased 
agr
icultural diversification and private investments in processing for many of 
the higher value agricultural commodities are likely to generate new rural 
nonfarm employment opportunities and contribute to higher rural incomes. 
 
(ix) Rice dominates both food c
onsumption and agricultural 
production
 
Rice ac
counts
 
for about a third of total gross cropped area and nearly 
60 percent of irrigated area in Tamil Nadu (over 90 percent of paddy is 
irrigated). Pulses (18 percent of total cropped area), millets (11 percent
), 
and groundnuts (10 percent) require less 
water than rice or sugar
-
cane, and 
millets and pulses are grown almost exclusively on non
-
irrigated land. About 
5 percent of total c
ropped area is devoted to sugar
-
cane, all of it irrigated 
(accounting for almost
 
10 percent of irrigated land). Cotton occupies about 3 
percent of cropped area, and about a third of the cotton crop is irrigated.  
 
(x) The livestock and fisheries subsectors are also important in Tamil 
Nadu
 
The state ranks second among Indian states in 
egg production and 
ninth in milk production. The state is also relatively well endowed with 
fisheries, accounting for 13.2 percent of total marine fish production and 4 
percent of in
-
land fish production in India. In all, crop agriculture, livestock, 
and a
nimal husbandry account for 92.2 percent of total value added in 
agriculture and allied activities, with fishing accounting for 4.5 percent and 
forestry for 3.3 percent. 
 
(xi) The average size of individually held farms is only 0.91 hectares, 
with over 
half the farms smaller than 0.5 hectares
 
Nearly three
-
quarters of farms are smaller than 1 hectare, accounting 
for only 30.2 percent of total cultivable land. In comparison, the average 
farm size in India is 1.41 hectares, with 62 percent of farmers holdin
g less 
than 1 hectare.

2.1.1 
Growth Trends of GSDP in Tamil Nadu
 
 
It is well recognized that Tamil Nadu is one of the relatively developed 
and fast growing states in the country, with considerable progress achieved 
in various facets of development. Looking at 
state

GSDP growth rate (at constant 
prices) since the late nineties
, d
uring 1996
-
97 to 2007
-
08, the average annual growth rate of GSDP of Tamil Nadu was 
6.26 percent (Table 2.1) and that of GDP of the country was 6.97 percent 
(not shown). In comparative terms, growth rate of GSDP of Tamil Na
du has 
been more than the GDP growth in many years but the reverse is also true 
for some years.

.1.2 Sectoral Growth Pattern  
 
 
Different 
sectors plays crucial role in the economic system. Without 
the sect oral contribution to the economy we cannot achieve the 
economic growth. Sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, tertiary plays 
crucial role in the growth of economic system.

ows the sector
al growth pattern in Tamil Nadu, during 
1997

09. T
he average growth in the agriculture sector was 
very 
low. Agriculture grew at an annual rate of about 3.7 percent. It is noticed that 
agriculture grew at 3.21 percent per annum duri
ng the Ninth Plan period. 
Although it  registered negative growth in the first two years of the Tenth 
Plan period (due to drought in those years), the state achieved 4.26 percent 
growth 
rate in 
agriculture as against the target of 3.79 percent.
 
Table 2.1:
 
Annual Growth Rates of 
GSDP at Constant (1999
-
00) Prices
 
                                                                                             
(
 
in 
Percent)
 
 
In the first two years of the Eleventh Plan period also, agriculture 
recorded a negative 
growth due to widespread floods
 
during the north
-
east 
monsoon.
 
The manufacturing sector grew at about 5.5 percent and the 
24
 
 
tertiary sector at 8 percent
 
during 1997
-
98 to 2006
-
07
. 
Thereafter that, these 
sectors are declined to 
-
4.93 percent and 3.35 percent 
during 2007
-
08 to 
2008
-
09. 
There are signs that the Tamil Nadu economy has emerged out of 
the recession of the early years of the 
last 
decade with the overall GSDP 
growth during 1997
-
98 to 2006
-
07 close to 6.6 percent. 
 
 
 
Growth rates of manufacture and te
rtiary sectors during the Tenth Plan 
period were relatively high as compared to the growth rates during the Ninth 
Plan period (that included the recession years). As a result, the overall 
economy grew faster at a rate of more than 8 percent during the Tent
h Plan 
as compared to its growth of 4.7 percent during the Ninth Plan. However, 
the average annual rate of growth of GSDP declined to 4.5 percent (as 
against the target of 9 percent) during the last two years (i.e, first two years 
of the Eleventh Plan): 20
07
-
08 and 2008
-
09. The fall in the overall GSDP 
growth was mainly due to the negative growth of agricultural sector. The 
other sectors also recorded decelerated growth
 
rate
s compared to previous 
years, which might be because of the global economic slowdown
.  
 
Fig 2.2: Sectoral Growth in Tamil Nadu

Fig 2.2 shows the sectoral growth pattern in Tamil Nadu, highlighting 
the high volatility of the primary sector (which comprises agriculture and 
allied activities).  All three sectors went through a recession in
-
between 
2000
-
01 and 2002
-
03. After that, the growth was accelerated in all sectors 
up to the end of the Tenth Plan (2006
-
07). Then, there has been 
deceleration in the annual growth of all sectors and particularly agriculture 
has registered negative growth
. The formulation of a medium to long term 
fiscal strategy to achieve the targets of the Eleventh Plan 
had
 
to take into 
account the changing structure of the state economy and economic 
slowdown in the recent years.
 
2.1.3 Changing Structure of GSDP 
 
In t
he 
structure of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in many 
states, particularly in Tamil Nadu, has been shifting away from agriculture 
towards manufacturing and more towards services.  As indicated in Table 
2.2, during the Ninth Plan Period (i.e., from 1997
-
98 to 2001
-
02), the share 
of agriculture in the total GSDP measured at constant prices declined from 
17.7 percent to 14.8 percent (i.e., it registered about 3 percentage points 
decline) and the share of secondary sector also declined from 33.4 percent 
to 2
7.1 percent (i.e., it fell by about 6.3 percentage points). At the same 
time, the contribution of tertiary sector increased from 47.0 percent to 55.8 
percent, registering an increase of 8.7 percentage points
.
 
During the Tenth Plan period (2002
-
03 to 2006
-
0
7), shares of 
agriculture, secondary sector and tertiary sector remained more or less 
stable at 11 percent, 30 percent and 57 percent respectively. However, in 
2008
-
09, the share of agriculture declined by about 2 percentage points 
from the end of Tenth Pl
an period (2006
-
07) and reached 9.4 percent level 
and the share of manufacturing also declined by about 1.5
 
percentage 
points. The share of tertiary sector increased from 56.8 percent in 2006
-
07 
to 60.6 percent in 2008
-
09.

2.3 Crop Growth in Tamil Nadu
 
 
The major crops like paddy, millets (coarse cereals), pulses, oil seeds, 
sugarcane and cotton are raised in the State. These accounted for 60 
percent
 
of the 
total cropped area in the State during 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11. Paddy, the staple food 
crop was princip
ally grown in the delta districts of Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and 
Nagapattinam. The average growth of area under paddy witnessed a negative 
growth of 0.14 per
 
during 2007 to 2010. In line with this, the yield and production had 
experienced a negative growt
h o
f 2.35 percent and 2.26 per
cent, respectively. The 
share of millets viz. cholam, cumbu
 
(Jowar), ragi
 
and maize and korrah, varahu and 
samai formed 25 
percent
 
of the total cereals and 20 
percent
 
of the total food grains 
in
 
2010
-
11. There was an increasing d
emand for maize grains for human consumption 
due to structural changes taking place in a consumption pattern in view of rising real 
per capita income. The diversified uses of maize, corn, starch industry, corn oil 
pr
oduction, baby corns, popcorns
 
and poten
tial for exports had
 
added to the demand 
for maize. A
rea under millets
 
witnessed a decline by 3.4 per
cent
 
compared to the 
previous years.
 
T
he yield rate marginally came down from 2504 kgs/ha
.
 
in 2009
-
10 to 
2467 kgs/ha. in 2010
-
11. The average growth of are
a had experience
d a negative 
growth of 2.37 per
cent. Production and yield rate of m
illets had improved by 6.55 
per
cent respectively 
in
 
2010
-
11. 
 
The pulses like green gram, b
engal 
gram, black gram, horse gram 
are the main 
contributors 
to
 
the pulses
 
product
ion
 
in the state. The average growth of area un
der 
pulses improved by 5.12 per
cent. However, the yield rate and production witnessed a 
negative 
growth of 4.46 per
cent and 0.92
 
percent.
 
Food grains constitute a vital source for the livelihood 
of the common 
men. It 
accounted for 73 per
cent of the total crops in the State.  Production and yield rate of 
food grains had recorded a negative growth of meagre 1.40 
percent
, 1.49 
percent
 
respectively during 
the 
first four years of 
the 
Eleventh Five Year Plan period. 
 
The State ranks third in sugarcane produ
ction at all
-
India level. Sugar
-
cane is 
the main commercial crop under food crops grown predominantly in the selected 
districts of Tamil Nadu. The average growth of area, production and yield rate of 
28
 
 
sugarcane exhib
ited a negative growth of 4.88 
percent
, 5.93 
percent
 
and 1.46 
percent
 
respectively during 2010
-

Cotton is another commercial crop 
being grown in the State. Th
e average 
growth of area and
 
production of cotton registered a growth of 5.39 percent and 3.60 
percent
 
respectively. However, the yield rate of cotton decreased by 0.05 
percent
 
during 2006 to 2010.

2.4 Growth Performance of Agriculture in Tamil Nadu 
 
2.4.1 Overall Growth in Agriculture
 
The agriculture sector continues to be the backbone of the State economy, 
providing 44 
percent
 
of the total employment in T
amil Nadu. Of the total gross 
cropped area of 57.53 lakh hectares, the gross area irrigated was 32.38 lakh 
hectares (56%) and the rest (44%) was under rainfed cultivation. 
During 2009
-
10 
t
otal agri
cultural income 
stood at Rs. 30975/
-
 
crores, registering a growth of 6.1 
percent over the
 
previous year in 2008
-
09. In 2010
-
11, the income originating from 
agriculture and allied activities was estimated to increase by 4.5 
percent
 
to touch Rs. 
32381/
-
 
crores.
 
 
The net area sown stood at 49.54 lakh hectares in 2010
-
11. The land put to 
non
-
agric
ultural uses marginally
 
increased from 21.76 lakh ha. i
n 2009
-
10 to 21.77 
lakh ha. in 2010
-
11.  Of the total geographical area, forest accounted for 16.3 
percent 
(21.25 lakh ha.
). The current fallow lands decreased from 11.17 lakh ha. (8.6%) in 
2009
-
10 to 
10.15 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11 (7.8%). The barren and cultivable land 
accounted for 3.8 percent in 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11.
 
 
The gross area sown and net area sown had marginally improved by 3.2 
percent
 
and 1.3 
percent
 
in 2010
-
11 respectively. The cropping intensity
 
also 
increased from 113.9 
percent
 
in 2009
-
10 to 116.1 percent in 2010
-
11.
 
 
T
he index of agricultural production is found to be moderate during 2010
-
11. 
Area increased from 78.83
 
ha.
 
during 2009
-
10 to 81.39
 
ha.
 
during 2010
-
11. 
Correspondingly, the producti
on also increased from 116.37
 
tonnes
 
to 118.10
 
tonnes
. By contrast, the index for productivity had decreased from 113.53 
kgs/ha.
to 
111.72
 
kgs/ha
. Total food grain production has increased to 71.02 lakh tonnes during 
2010
-
11. Acceleration in agricultural pr
oduction is essential to ensure food security, 
livelihood security, and nutrition security. In this context
,
 
agricultural sector has to 
grow at a rate of 4 
percent
 
annually considering the dynamic factors such as rising 
real per capita income, growing popu
lation and income elasticity of demand for food. 
All the major crops such as pad
dy, cereals, food grains, sugar
cane, cotton, oil seeds, 
horticulture and sericulture had fared moderately.

2.4.2 Growth Performance of Horticulture Crops in Tamil Nadu
 
In Tami
l Nadu, agriculture contributes 12 
percent
 
of the GSDP, while the share 
of horticulture to the GSDP is estimated at 3.5 
percent
. The net sown area is 36 
percent
 
of the total geographical area (national average is 46 
percent
). The gross 
cropped area is 532,000 ha with a cropping intensity of 116.1 Irrigation covers 46 
percent
 
of the cropped area and the remaining 54 
percent
 
is rain
-
fed. 
The state
 
accounts for nearly 6 
percent
 
of the area under fruits and 4 
percent
 
of the area
 
under 
vegetables in the country. In terms of production, the
 

per
cent in fruits and
 
6 per
cent in vegetables. 
The state
 
is also a leading in the 
production of flowers. The total area under horticultural crops was 7.99 lakh ha
.
 
and
 
the total production was 176.78 lakh tonnes 
in
 
TE 2010
-
11.
 
2.4.3
 
Growth Performance of Principal Crops in Tamil Nadu
 
Table 2.5 represents the 
plan 
wise details of the area, production and
 
yield of 
paddy, food grains, total cereals, total pulses 
and groundnuts. It could very well be 
seen that the overall output of the all the crops have a significant rise during the 
Tenth
 
Five Year Plan period. The area under all crops in the state has declined and 
specifically the area under groundnut
s has declin
ed to the tune of 
27.95 
Percent
 
in

Table 2.3 reveals that the total area under all horticultural crops in Tamil 
Nadu remarkably incr
eased from 6.04 lakh ha during T
riennium 
 
E
nding 1990
-
91 to 7.99 lakh ha during TE 2010
-
11. In tune with the increase in 
area, the production of horticultural crops also tremendously increased from 70.87 
lakh tonnes to 176.78 lakh tonnes over a period of 2 decades. Analyzing the 
growth of area and production
 
of horticultural crops, the table vividly shows, that 
there was a steady increase in area and production 
 
The growth rate in area and yield of horticultural crops in Tamil Nadu for the 
period 1990
-
91 to 2008
-
09 is depicted in Table 2.4
. T
here was a fall i
n growth 
rate of area and yield of all horticultural crops in Tamil Nadu during the period 
1990
-
91 to 2008
-
09. Again a significant growth rate of 2.5 
percent
 
in area and 
4.8 
percent
 
in yield could be observed from 2000
-
01 to 2008
-
09. The table 
reveals that
 
the growth rate of yield declined to 1.52 
percent
 
during 2004
-
05 from 
3.80 
percent
 
during 
the period 2004
-
05 to 2007
-
08. A
lthough the growth rate of 
area increased to 3.47 
percent
 
from 2.28 
percent
.
 
From table 2.5 it is clear that the
 
area under cereals declined to 2.16 
percent
 
during the 
Eleventh
 
Five Year Plan period, but
 
the production and
 
the 
yield had 
increased to 52.93 
percent
 
and 49.71 
percent
 
during the corresponding 
period.
 
In the case of groundnut
s, the plan period
-
wise growth (yield) performance 
has a consistent increase. However, despite the decline in area during the 
Eleventh 
Five Year Plan
 
period
, the yield has been high 
when compared with the
 
Tenth 
Five Year Plan
 
period
. Though there is an increase in the area f

-
11. It is found from the table that, among cereal crops, maize 
has recorded the positive and highest growth rate of 36.45 
percent
 
per annum, 
which was evidently contributed by the high profitability from maize in Tamil 
35
 
 
Nadu. It was found to
 
be statistically significant at one 
percent
 
level. Other 
selected cereal crops recorded decline in area as evident from negative rate of 
growth per annum. The largest decline in area has been recorded by ragi at the 
rate of 
-
42.45
percent
 
per annum followe
d by cumbu, cholam and paddy. In the 
case of yield of selected cereal crops, the result reveals that cumbu and cholam 
recorded the significant positive growth rates of 1.15
 
percent
 
per annum 
respectively
 
However, in the case of cholam and ragi, the evidenc
e provides negative 
growth rate of 
-
5.37
 
percent
 
per annum respectively. This is followed by paddy 
that registered lowest negative growth rate of 
-
3.61
 
percent
 
per annum in the 
case of yield. B
esides, the growth performance,
 
production reveals that maize 
h
as recorded the positive and significant growth rate of 67.10 
percent
 
per annum, 
which was evidently contributed by the high profitability from maize in Tamil 
Nadu.
 
The largest decline in production has been recorded by cumbu at the rate of 
-
81.80
 
percent
 
per annum followed by cholam, paddy and ragi. The state 
government took several efforts during the study period in order to increase the 
yield and production in the case of the major cereal crops by mechanization of 
production by utilization of farm machin
ery in agriculture at subsidized prices and 
granting loans for investment in agricultural infrastructure, supplying inputs such 
as fertilizers, pesticides and seeds and pricing policy for several main crops. But 
the analysis over the study period provides 
evidence that only maize has 
recorded positive and the highest growth rate per annum in terms of area and 
production in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, in the case of yield of major selected cereal 
crops, the analysis reveals that maize has registered the positive 
and significant 
growt
h performance along with cumbu. T
his was made possible by the high 
profitability from maize and cumbu. In sum, paddy has registered good 
performance in 
the state
 
in absolute terms, as far as the other cereal crops are 
36
 
 
concerned. But th
e
 
Annual
 
Compound Growth Rate (
A
CGR) reveals that the 
performance of maize was found to be positive and recorded the highest growth 
rate per annum among other cereal corps in terms of performance of area of 
cultivation, yield and production over the study 
period. Besides, cumbu provides 
positive and significant growth rate per annum only in case of performance of 
yield. Despite the fact that maize was found to acquire the highest place in terms 
of area of cultivation and production among other cereal crops,
 
it cannot serve 
the purpose of livelihood for majority of the population in the 
State
. Hence, 
priority 
is given to paddy cultivation
. Besides, the study suggests that the farmers can 
also cultivate maize for the money
-
making purpose in Tamil Nadu because 
the 
climatic conditions of the state are ideal for the cultivation of maize.

Drivers of Growth in Agriculture 
 
Agricultural growth 
is mainly depend upon the
 
growth in crop output; 
diversification of agriculture towards high valued crops 
and livestock products 
and increa
se in value of the given output. 
Examining these three aspects of 
agricultu
ral growth in Tamil Nadu reveal
 
that the overall growth in area, yield and 
production of major crops in the State is quite impressive in the recent 
past. The 
share of principal and horticultural crops in 
Gross Cropped Area (
GCA
) is 
increased substantially during the last two decades which proves that the process 
37
 
 
of diversification of agriculture towards high valued crops is in right direction, 
while t
here is a need for increasing the pace of diversification towards high 
valued cash crops in the state.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and the 
National Horticulture Mission (NHM
) have also emerged as the path
-
breaking 
interventions which have helped
 
in agricultural diversification towards cash crops 
in Tamil Nadu. The growth in livestock in the state is also remarkable. 
 
Animal husbandry and fisheries sectors are providing employment, thereby 
enabling the rural folk to get income besides c
ontributing
 
to State income siz
ably. 
Their contribution to t
he Gross State Domestic Product stood at 2.74 
percent
 
and 
that to the agriculture and allied activities was at 36.45 
percent
. The Eleventh 
Five Year Plan
 
period
 
envisaged an overall growth of 6.7 
percent
 
per annum in 
livestock sector. The milk production in the State witnessed a marginal 
improvement (2.04
 
percent
) from 66.51 lakh tonnes in 2008
-
09 to 67.87 lakh 
tonnes in 2009
-
10.The meat production decreased marginally from 1048.19 lakh 
kgs.
 
in 2009
-
10 to
 
1037.88 lakh kgs.
 
in 2010
-
11. 
 
The c
ontribution of egg production
 
in Tamil Nadu
 
to all
-
India level during 
2010
-
11 worked out to 18 
percent
. Per capita availability of eggs in 
the state
 
was 
165 against the per capita availability of 53 eggs at all
-
India le
vel in 2010
-
11.
 
And 
 
State 
occupies the third rank in fish production in the country.  So far as the 
increase in value of the agricultural output is concerned, it is noteworthy that the 
prices of agricultural commodities have increased successively over th
e years in 
the state resulting in the rise in the value of output. However, the majority of 
farmers do not get remunerative prices because of constraints in marketing 
channels and infrastructures resulting in lower value of their output. 
 
 
2.4.6
 
Agricultur
al Marketing
 
A
gricultural marketing plays an important role in fostering and sustaining the 
tempo of rural economic development.
 
Agriculture is dependent on marketing 
38
 
 
support and thereby it minimizes the risk of the farmers besides getting an 
assured and f
air price for ensuring a remunerative return to them. The 
Agricultural Marketing
 
Board
,
 
Government of Tami Nadu were started at
 
1977.
 
The 
main
 
objectives of this board are regulate the agriculture business in the 
State runned institutions, private Mandis. 
Regulated markets was renamed as 

.
 
It is focusing on
 
creation and strengthening of post
-
harvest management infrastructure for value 
addition of agricultural commodities, food processing and export.
 
 
U
nder agricultural marketing, 21 market committees and 277 regulated 
markets were formed and no fee is collected from the farmers. However, one 
percent
 
of the sale value of the produce is being collected as market fee from 
traders besides licence fee collec
ted from traders and weighmen. In addition to 
this, 144 godowns are functioning and 
this 
ensured the competitive and 
remunerative prices under market committees. Further, 15 check posts existing 
under market committees had been abolished for the free movem
ent of 
agricultural produce. The marketing facilities were created and provided by the 
marketing committees in the State.
 

and 21 market committees were provided with internet connecti
vity for the 
effective price dissemination among farmers through Agmarketnet website.
 
The overall food and non
-
food crops sold through the Regulated Markets had 
witnessed a fall from 14.16 lakh metric tonnes in 2009
-
10 to 13.41 lakh metric 
tonnes in 
2010
-
11. On an average, the market arrivals per regulated market had 
come down from 5788 tonnes in 2009
-
10 to 4912 tonnes in 2010
-
11. However, 
the total value of agricultural produce transacted (food and non food crops) by 
regulated markets had improved fr
om Rs.2050 crores in 2009
-
10 to Rs.2296 
crores in 2010
-
11(12
percent
), of which paddy alone accounted for 57 
percent
 
during 2010

Natural Resource Management
 
 
Natural resources are an important source for agricultural and human 
development in a society. Without the natural resources cannot survive the 
human nature in the world. 
Land, water resources, 
soil and biodiversity which are 
the natural resources for agriculture are under considerable strain
 
in the State
. 
The demand for meeting food and water for a growing population from shrinking 
natural resources base has shifted the focus to enhance agricult
ural production in 
a 
sustainable manner.

occurrence of drought.
 
The 
annual rainfall of the zone varies from
 
524 to 1428 mm wi
th an average of 780 mm. 
The maximum temperature of the zone ranges from 26.9 to 42.1°C and the 
minimum from 16.2 to 24.5°C.
 
Being an interior region, the diurnal variation in 
temperature is large
 
particularly in the dry and hot seasons.

It is a deltaic zone. Cauvery is the 
river traversing the delta. The terrain is an open plain sloping gently towards east 
and d
evoid of any hills or hillocks. The altitude ranges from 6 to 250 m above MSL.
 
The c
auvery delta zone has diverse climatic conditions as the zone includes coastal 
belt as well as inland area. Cyclonic storms and high humidity occur in coastal 
belts. The co
astal belt is favoured by high rainfall and when it proceeds to the

3.2 Land Use Pattern
 
 
G
eographical area of 
Tamil Nadu is 
130.33 lakh hectares
. It
 
is the eleventh 
largest state of India.  It can be observed from table 3.2 that the net area sown stood 
at 49.54 lakh h
a.
 
in 2010
-
11. The land put to non
-
agricultural uses marginally 
increased from 21.76 lakh ha. in 2009
-
10 to 21.77 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11. T
his was 
mainly due to increase in population, urbanization and industrialization. Of the total 
geographical area, forests accounted for 16.3 
percent
 
(21.25 lakh h
a.
). The current 
fallow lands decreased from 11.17 lakh ha. (8.6 
percent
) in 2009
-
10 to 10.15 
lakh 
ha. in 2010
-
11 (7.8
 
percent
). The barren and uncultivable land accounted for 3.8 
percent
 
in 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11.
 
On the other hand, the other fallow lands increased from 15.42 lakh ha. in 
2009
-
10 to 15.80 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11. The permanent pastures an
d other grazing 
lands were very meagre and shared only 0.8 
percent
 
of the total geographical area. 
The cultivable waste and miscellaneous tree crops amounted to 2.5 
percent
 
and 1.9 
percent
 
respectively 
during
 
2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11. When compared to the previ
ous 
year (2009
-
10), the cultivable waste marginally increased from 3.26 lakh ha in 
2009
-
10 to 3.31 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11.
 
The gross area sown and net area sown have marginally improved by 3.2 
percent
 
and 1.3 
percent
 
in 2010
-
11 respectively. The cropping inte
nsity also 
increased from 113.9

3.3 Cropping Intensity 
 
Cropping intensity is a measure of both quantum and spread of precipitation, 
soil moisture index and gross area irrigated. Tamil Nadu agriculture is water
-
starved 
so that the cropping intensity is not of higher order. The State is in dire need of 
economizi
ng on scarce water resources available and they must 
be
 
put 
to 
effective 
use. Optimization of water use can be accomplished by getting the maximum output 
per drop of water.

3.4 Landh
olding Size
 
 
Over a period of time, the agricultural 
land is declining in Indian and Tamil 
Nadu. Particularly, operational holdings of the land is became decline due to various 
social and economic conditions in the society. 
Operational holding 
is one of the 
determine factors of 
agricultural production and pr
oductivity. The operational 
holdings as per Agricultural census are furnished in Table 3.4. The
 
results of confirm 
the growing imbalance and asymmetry
 
in the distribution of the size of 
land 
holdings
 
pattern in Tamil Nadu
.
 
The marginal and small farmers who constituted a higher proportion of 91 
percent
 
of the total farmers held a lesser extent of land holdings (59
 
percent
), 
whereas medium and large farmers who formed 2.3 
percent
 
of the total farmers 
possessed a larger chunk 
of 20 
percent
 
of land holdings. Thus, the distribution of 
land holding
s
 
is highly skewed. It is one of the causative factors for low productivity.

Ceilings on L
andh
oldings
 
 
The skewed distribution of land
holdings in Tamil Nadu leads to disparities in the 
income in the rural areas. In view of this, attempts were made in the past to 
distribute the excess land through land reforms. The First Five Year P
lan 
period 
categorically stated that there should be an absolute limit to the size of land which 
any individual may hold. 
 
Ceiling on Landh
oldings Act was enacted to reduce the inequal
ity in the 
distribution of land
holdings
 
in the society. It
 
was fixed by 
the Madras Land Reform
s 
(Fixation of Ceiling on Landh
oldings) Act, 1961. The ceiling limit was lowered by the 
Madras Land Reform (Reduct
ion of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 
1972.
 
As per the new guidelines, the range of ceiling of Tamil Nadu has
 
the limit of 
24.28 hectares for dry land and for irrigated lands with two cro
ps, the limit was 4.86 
ha.;
 
for irrigated lands with one crop
, the limit is 12.14 ha
.

3.6 Water Resources
 
The total water potential of the State including groundwater is 46,540 million 
cubic metres (MCM). The total surface water is 24,160 MCM, including the 
contribution
 
from neighbouring states of Andhra
 
Pradesh
, Karnataka and Kerala. Of 
the total water potential, the surface water potential 
is 
about 2.4 million h
a.
 
has 
almost been fully (more than 95 percent) tapped since the late sixties. Groundwater 
is, therefore, the only alternative source available for further development
. 
There are 
34 river basins falling into 17 basin groups in Tamil Nadu.

The dependency on ground water has increased mani
fold during the recent 
years. T
he ground water extraction for irrigation, 
domestic 
use 
and industries have 
resulted in lowering of water levels, long
-
term water level declining trend and even 
drying up of wells. In order to regulate the groundwater development, Central 
Ground Water Board
 
and
 
State Ground Water 
Board,
 
has compute
d dynamic 
ground water resources and categorized blocks
 
in Tamil Nadu
. 
 
The net ground water availability for irrigation 
purposes
 
has been computed as 
the difference between net annual ground water availability and the gross ground 
water draft including the allocation for domestic and industrial uses for the next 
twenty five years. The computation indicates that balance ground water
 
potential is 
not available for future irrigation development in the maj
or part of Coimbatore, 
Dharmapur
i, Krishnagiri, Dindigul, Nagapattinam, Namakkal, Salem, Theni, Vellore 
and Tiruvannamalai districts
. The

3.7 Weather and Climate
 
 
The geographical location of Tamil Nadu is such that the climatic condition 
shows only slight seasonal variati
ons. Due to close proximity to the sea, the 
temperatures and humidity remain relatively high all the year round. The climate of 
Tamil Nadu is tropical in nature with little variation in summer and winter 
temperatures. While April
-
June is the hottest summer
 
period (with the temperat
ure 
rising up to the 40ºC mark)
 
November
-
February is the coolest winter period (with 
temperatures hovering around 20ºC), making the climate quite pleasant.
 
 
 
More than 75 
percent
 
of annual rainfall in India is received from South West 
Monsoon. However, the rainfall received during North East Monsoon (>50
 
percent
) 
in the State has an added advantage and helps in the production of food crops than 
South West monsoon rainfall (>30
 
per
cent
).
 
 
The rainfall during South
-
West Monsoon (July
-
September) in 2010
-
11 recorded 
at 383.6 mm was (20.2 
percent
) higher than the normal rainfall of 319.2 mm and 21 
percent
 
more than 2009
-
10 level. The rainfall was excess in 13 districts and normal 
in 19 
districts. During the season, 
the 
highest rainfall was received in the Niligiris 
district (1211.7mm) and the lowest rainfall of 109.5 mm was recorded in 
Thoothukudi district in the State.
 
50
 
 
 
During North East Monsoon (October
-
December), the State had recorde
d an 
average rainfall of 605.2 mm which was higher by 40.6 
percent
 
over the normal 
rainfall of 430.3 mm. during 2010
-
11. However, the rainfall was lower by 11.9 
percent
 
over the previous year 
of 
2009
-
10. The rainfall was normal in 6 districts and 
excess in
 
26 districts
 
during 2010
-
11. The highest rainfall of 1118.8 mm was 
recorded in Thiruvallur district and Krishnagiri district experienced the lowest rainfall 
of 405.2 mm. 
 
 
The State 
is 
received an overall rainfall of 116.1 mm during 2010
-
11 which was 
higher by 28.2 
percent
 
over the normal 908.6 mm. and 24 
percent
 
higher than that 
of the previous year 2009

10. The total rainfall was excess in 22 districts and normal 
in 10 districts.
 
 
The 
overall improvement in area, production and productivity 
is 
depends on the 
ideal spatio
-
temporal distribution of rainfall. The State
 
is
 
received normal rainfall 
during South West Monsoon in 2009
-
10 and excess rainfall in 2010
-
11. However, 
the Mettur dam wa
s opened for irrigation belatedly after the scheduled date (12
th
 
June) on 28
th
 
July in the two years under reference.
 
 
The temporal and spatial spread of rainfall had helped much to store water in 
the reservoirs in the State
 
during South West Monsoon. Tota
l rainfall durin
g the 
south west, north
 
east monsoon and hot weather period during 2010
-
11 was better 
as compared to previous year 2009
-
10. The precipitation during north east monsoon 
was encouraging during the period and facilitated cultivation of rabi cr
ops and 
thereafter the rainfall was heavy and scattered during the 3
rd
 
and 4
th
 
week of 
November 2010. This led to the crop inundation in 26 districts and samba paddy 
crop raised during 2010 was severely affected.

Farm Inputs: Requirements, Availability and Prices
 
 
 
 
After 1960s, t
he phenomenal growth in agricultural production has 
been 
triggered by higher input use. P
articularly purchased inputs as well as 
technology induced productivity enhancement. The key inputs which 
changed the complexion of agriculture include HYV (High Yield
ing Variety) 
seeds, chemical fertilizers, irrigation, pesticides, farm machinery and 
equipments, credit and labour.
 
4.1 Seeds
 
Seeds are one of the major inputs being supplied for the cultivation of 
agriculture crops. They are the crucial input for sustaine
d growth in the farm 
production. Ensuring adequacy in improved seed quality and varietal 
diversity is also important. In order to make available adequate quantity of 
quality seeds at right time to the farming 
community, T
he Department of 
Seed Certification
 
is implementing seed certification, seed quality control, 
seed testing and training schemes. The main function of seed certification is 
to encourage the production of adequate quantities of genetically pure a
nd 
good quality seeds. P
articularly
,
 
high poten
tial, improved and hybrid 
varieties of different crops. 
 
 
To protect the interest of the farmers, seed trade has to be constantly 
monitored by inspecting the s
eed dealer points periodically. The 
government 
must have a constant vigil on the marketing of see
ds by taking seed 
samples in the seed lots distributed to the farming community. At present 
6623 seed selling points are available in Tamil Nadu.
 
 
Seed testing is being carried out to analyse the quality of the seed lots. 
Factors like germination, physical
 
purity, moisture, seed health and 
admixture of other distinguishable varieties are being analysed in the 

53
 
 
released by the Government of India. Seven notified seed testing 
laboratories
 
are functioning in Tamil Nadu

The production and yield rate of crops mainly depend on the quality of 
seeds with more specific emphasis on genetic and physical purity. The 
desirable Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) for achieving higher product
ivity 
was 25 
percent
 
for self
-
pollinated crops like paddy, ragi, pulses, groundnut
s
, 
gingelly and 35 
percent
 
for cross
-
pol
linated crops such as cholam, c
umbu 
and cotton and 100 
percent
 
for hybrids. The quality seeds are distributed 
through government depar
tments
, co
-
operative 
societies
, and private outlets 
in the State.
 
 
4.2 Fertilisers
 
The use of chemical fertilizers and their intensification in many a
reas 
are being reviewed. The 
Government is encouraging the application of 
appropriate fertilizers relevant to the soil and crops based on soil test 
recommendations. 
 
 
4.2.1 Chemical Fertilizers
 
 
The balanced and the optimum use of chemical fertilizers
 
is 
helps to 
improve the productiv
ity of crops. In Tamil Nadu, a total number of 12062 
retail outlets are eng
aged in fertilizer distribution. Out of that, 
which private 
retail outlets accounted for 78 percent and
 
the rest being the cooperative 
societies
.
 
54
 
 
 
The consumption of N,P,K in Tamil 
Nadu is found to be in the ratio of 
2:1:1 as against the conventionally accepted ratio of 4:2:1 indicating 
imbalance in the application of these three chemical nutrients. Continuation 
of subsidy on urea while decontrolling phosphate and potash fertilizers 
further adds to the inadvertent promotion of imbalance in fertilizer  use on 
the one hand and excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers in the other 
leading to environmental pollution and lowering of profits to the farmers. It is 
not only confined to the us
e of NPK
,
 
but also need based application of 
nutrients like sulphur, zinc, iron and boron
. It is 
become essential for 
exploiting of high yield varieties. The major constraints for adopting ration
al 
crop nutrition schedules are:
 

 
Inadequate availability of s
traight fertilizers of nutrients other than 
NPK and Zinc
 

 
Less exposure of extension agencies towards rational crop nutrition 
schedules
 

 
Lack of strong policy support on balanced fertilizer use
 

 
Inadequate soil testing facilities; and 
 

 
Lack of awareness among
 
farmers.
 
 
Soil health is to be preserved. The soil test based application of 
fertilizer is being advocated in the State. For analyzing the soil samples, 
there are 30 soil testing laboratories and 16 mobile soil testing laboratories 
functioning in the Stat
e. During 2009
-
10, out of 11.33 lakh soil samples 
taken, 9.75 lakh soil samples were analyzed in the State. Apart from this, 
the soil test is being done through agri
-
clinics with mini soil testing facilities 
in all the 385 blocks at a cost of Rs.11.93 cror
es under 
National Agricultural 
Development Programme (
NADP
)
. However, the farmers were advised to 
apply quality inputs and soil health cards were issued to 21.75 lakh farmers. 
The application of inorganic fertilizers (NPK) was calculated on the basis of 
da
ta received from Agricultural department. 
 
 
The total application of chemical fertilizers had come down from 12.65 
lakh tonnes in 2008
-
09 to 12.14 lakh tonnes in 2009
-
10; however, it 
55
 
 
marginally 
improve 
to 12.29 lakh tonnes in 2010
-
11. The per hectare

4.2.2 Organic Manure
 
 
Micro organisms are essential for the soil health and they help to 
prevent the depletion of soil nutrient. Owing to intensive cropping, the 
organic matter content in the soil went down from 1.20 
p
ercent
 
in 1971 to 
0.68 
percent
 
in 2008 in the State. The organic matter improves the soil 
fertility and increases crop yield rate. To increase crop productivity, 
balanced use of organic fertilizer is being advocated in the State. 
Composting of farm waste using pleurotus vermicomposting
, application of 
bio
-
fertilizers
 
and
 
green manures were popularized in the cropping system. 
Under the scheme, a minikit worth of Rs.120/
-
 
containing five kilogram of 
urea, one kilogram of pleurotus and a technical pamphlet is being distributed 
to the farme
rs 
with 
free of cost.
 
 
The green manure corps like sunhemp, daincha, kolinji and seabania 
are helpful in fixing atmospheric nitrogen and help to remove salinity and 
acidity of soil. In the State, for the promotion of green manure cultivation, 
250
 
MTs of gr
een manure seeds were produced and distributed with 25 
percent
 
subsidy. On the other hand, for the application of vermi compost, a 
financial assistance of Rs.1200/
-
 
per demonstration tota
ll
ing 300 
demonstrations was provided to conduct training to 15000 fa
rmers at a cost 
of Rs.11.55 lakhs. The seven micro nutrients 
like
 
iron, copper, zinc, 
56
 
 
manganese, boron, molybdenum and chlorine are critical in nature. The 
micro nutrient deficiency in soil was tested in 19 soil testing laboratories and 
9 mobile soil testi
ng labs in the State. 
 
4.2.3 Bio
-
fertilizer
 
 
Bio
-
fertilizer component is vital for the Integrated Nutrient Management 
in the sense of eco
-
friendly and cost effective input. The biofertilizer packets 
are produced in six Biofertilizer Production Centres loca
ted at Cuddalore, 
Ramanathapuram, Salem
,
 
Kudum
iyanmalai, Sakkottai and Trichy. They 
distributed through Agricultural Extension Centres. Bio
-
fertilizers like 
Azospyrillum and Rhizobium help in fixing atmospheric nitrogen into the soil 
suitable for the growt
h of crops like paddy, millets and groundnut
s
. The bio
-
fertilizer is best suited for the growth of pulses. The bio
-
fertilizer production 
units (Six Nos.) in the State have the capacity of producing 1660 MT of 80 
lakh packets 
comprised of 200 gm. each per p
a
cket. The area covered 
under bio
-
fertilizer increased from 2.87 lakh ha. in 2009
-
10 to 3.39 lakh ha. 
in 2010
-
11.
 
4.2.4 Plant Protection
 
 
Under plant protection, the area treated against pests for food crops 
and non
-
food crops was 27.53 lakh ha. and 27.94 
lakh ha. in 20
09
-
10 and 
2010
-
11 respectively. 
Of the estimated demand of 6000 MT dust, 5000 kilo 
litres of liquid and 2500 MT of technical grade material, 4143 Mt of dust, 
4515 kilo litres of liquid and 2393 Mt of technical grade material were 
distributed 
during 2009
-
10. During 2010
-
11, 3507 MT (Dust), 4526 kilo litres 
(liquid) and 2550 MT (technical grade material) were distributed in the State.
 
4.2.5 Bio
-
Control Agents
 
Increasing demand for organic products and higher returns have made 
the farmers to incl
ine towards organic farming for which usage of biocides 
and bio
-
co
ntrol agents are essential. Bio
-
control agents are produced 
through the Government owned 12 Bio
-
Control Agents Production Centres 
57
 
 
and distributed to the farmers under various subsidy schemes
 
to control 
pests like rice leaf folder, sugarcane internode borer, coconut black headed 
caterpillar, coconut rhinoceros beetle, cotton bollworm, groundnut red hairy 
caterpillar and Prodenia.
 
 
4.3 Farm Mechanization
 
 
The States with a greater availability of farm power show higher 
productivity as compared to others. The details of agricultural implements 
and machinery in Tamil Nadu are furnished in Table 4.3. It could be 
observed from the table that a variety of agricu
ltural machinery and 
implements are available to meet the requirements of the farming 
community.

4.4 Irrigation
 
Irrigation is a vital input at different stages of cultivation of crops. The 
total irrigation potential in the 
country imp
roved from 81.1 million ha.
 
in 
58
 
 
1991
-
92 to 108.2 million h
a.
 

potential of 853 TMC, 261 TMC was contributed by neighbouring States and 
was utilized fully. Of the 385 blocks in 
the State, 139 blocks were 
over
-
exploited, 33 were critical, 67 were semi
-
critical and 11 were saline in 
nature. The balance of 136 blocks is considered to be safe in the State. So 
far, under artificial recharge of ground water through dug works, 19150 
recharge structures were const
ructed by the beneficiaries of both small and 
marginal farmers. The net area irrigated marginally improved from 28.6 lakh 
ha. in 2009
-
10 to 29.1 lakh ha. 
(
1.6 
percent) 
in 2010
-
11. The canal irrigation 
slightly came down from 7.6 lakh ha. to 75 lakh ha. in 
the 
same 
years
,
 
respectively. The area under tank irrigation witnessed a marginal increase 
from 5.0 lakh ha to 5.3 lakh ha. during the reference period. The gross area 
irrigated went up from 32.4 lakh ha to 33.48 lakh. ha (3.3
percent
). The 
irrigation inten
sity also improved from 113.3 
percent
 
to 115.1 
percent
. The 
gross area irrigated to gross area sown had slightly gone up from 58.12 
percent
 
to 58.23 
percent. T
he net area irrigated to the net area sown 
witnessed a marginal increase from 58.5 
percent
 
to 58.

4.5 Agricultural Wages and Classification of Agricultural Labourers
 
 
Statistics regarding daily wages paid to agricultural labourers are being 
collected every month from 385 villages, at one village per block. The 
agricultural labourers are classified into two groups, 
such as 
 

 
Field labourers and
 

 
Other agricultural 
labourers
 
Field labourers comprise of ploughmen, sowers, pluckers, transplanters, 
weeders, reapers and harvesters. Other agricultural labourers denote those 
who are engaged in watering of fields, carrying loads, digging wells and 
other agriculture related 
works.

4.6 Credit and Insurance
 
 
Availability of credit and agricultural insurances are important drivers of 
growth in agriculture. However, the formal credit is readily available to elite 
class people such as large and wealthy farmers who are trusted by the 
institutional lenders because
 
of their grater repayment capacity
;
 
on the other 
hand, the access of poor marginal and small farmers to institutional credit is 
quite limited (Swain, 2001). If we look at the disbursement of institutional 
credit in Tamil Nadu, State Cooperatives, Rashtiry
a Krishi Vikas Yojana 
(RKVY), Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme and Agricultural Technology 
60
 
 
Management (ATMA) are some of the major programs through which credit 
has been made available to the farmers in the State.
 
4.6.1. Crop Insurance
 
 
Under crop insuran
ce,
 
all farmers including share
-
croppers, tenant 
farmers growing insurable crops and availing Seasonal Agricultural 
Operations (SAO) on compulsory basis and all other farmers growing 
insurable crops 
like
 
non
-
loanee farmers who opt for the scheme on 
voluntary 
basis are covered.
 
Objectives:
 

 
To provide insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in 
the event of failure of crops as a result of natural calamities, pests 
and diseases.
 

 
To encourage farmers to adopt progressive farming practices, high 
value inputs and higher technology in agriculture.
 

 
To help stabilize farm incomes particularly in disaster years.
 

 
The Crop Insurance Scheme covers the food crops (cereals, millets 
and pulses), oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, annual commercial/annual 
horticult
ural crops. The State provides 50 
percent
 
as premium 
subsidy for both loanee and non
-
loanee farmers. In addition to the 
State subsidy, the Government of India also provides five 
percent
 
subsidy to small and marginal farmers.
 
 
The total number of farmers co
vered under the scheme improved from 
9.41 lakhs in 2009
-
10 to 9.65 lakhs in 2010
-
11. The total sum insured which 
was Rs.2740.9 crores had increased to Rs.3213.2 crores during the 
respective years
. 
Implementation of Crop Insurance Schemes in Tamil 
Nadu port
rays the exemplary efforts taken by the Department of 
Agriculture
, Government of Tamil Nadu
 
by its resounding success among 
the farmers.

The
 
State Government is 
making strenuous efforts to fine
-
tune the 
Crop Insurance Schemes by introducing interim compensation to insured 
farmers, reducing the insurance unit area to revenue village level, uniform 
seasonality discipline, on account payment, timely payment of claims etc., 
which will definitely moti
vate the farmers to take up risks in agriculture and 
stabilize the income of the farmers at the time of distress. The Crop 
Insurance Schemes 
is one of the main schemes in crop insurance. 
 
4.6.2 National Agricultural Insurance Scheme
 
The main
 
objective 
is 
t
o provide insurance coverage to the
 
farmers for 
the notified crops. It is 
provides financial support to the farmers in the event 
of failure of crops as a resu
lt of natural calamities. The 
encourage the 
farmers to adopt progressive farming practices and hig
h value inputs and 
help them 
to stabilize their farm income. P
articularly in disaster years 
has 
been implemented in Tamil N
adu 
since 
Kharif 
season 
2000 onwards.
 
Paddy, millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane, annual / 
commercial crops are insured unde
r the scheme. The scheme is operated in 
notified areas (block/ firka level) for notified crops. All loanee farmers 
growing notified crops are enrolled compulsorily while non
-
loanee farmers 
are enrolled on voluntary basis. 
 
The present premium subsidy 
pattern is given in the Table 4.7.

As the present insurance scheme is being operated on area approach 
depriving the farmers of certain benefits under the scheme, Government has 
proposed to redesign the scheme 
for the benefit of individual farmers.
 
 
4.6.3 Compensation under National Agricultural Insurance Scheme
 
In the event of crop loss due to natural calamities, Agricultural 
Insurance Company pays compensation upto
 
100
percent
 
for food and 
oilseed crops and 150
percent
 
for annual and
 
commercial crops, if the claim 
is less than the premium
 
collected. If the claim exceeds the premium 
amount, then
 
the exceeding amount is equally shared between Central and 
State Governments. During 2011
-
12, a sum of 7975.19 lakhs
 
of 
rupees 
was 
disbursed as compensation to 2.32 lakh farmers by the State Government.
 
4.6.4 Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme
 
The compensation extended under 
National Agricultural Insurance 
Scheme
 
(
NAIS
)
 
implemented from Kharif 2000 onwards is calculated based 
on the yield results of crop cutting experiments. However, the crop loss due 
to seasonal changes has not been accounted for. Therefore to overcome 
the shortcomings, 
This 
 
Scheme was introduced on `p
ilot basis. This 
scheme is being implemented to mitigate the hardship of the insured 
farmers against the likelihood of financial loss on account of anticipated crop 
loss due to adverse weather conditions
. The critical stages of a crop 
such as 
63
 
 
sowing, veget
ative, flowering and harvest stages are insured for weather 
p
arameters like excess / deficit
i
rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, 
consecutive dry days, wind speed, etc. The scheme is applicable to both 
loanee and non
-
loanee farmers and all notified cr
ops in the notified districts 
are insured. This scheme is implemented by AIC, ICICI Lombard GIC, 
IFFCO
-
TOKIO GIC, Cholamandalam GIC, and HDFC Ergo GIC.

Agricultural Education, Research and Extension
 
5.1 Agricultural Education
 
Food and nutrition are the two important aspects which warrant 
importance in the present day context. Amidst the challenges of shrinking 
resources and escalating cost of inputs, the productivity of food grains has 

led. Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University is spearheading its triple major activities of Education, Research 
and Extension converged to work in synergy to bring forth 
Second Green 
Revolution
 
in agriculture.
 
Nevertheless, a growth rate of 4
percent
 
in agriculture is essential to 
raise the GDP by 9
percent
 
by the end of the 
Twelfth
 
Five Year Plan
 
period
. 
All the research strategies are planned to achieve this target without any 
shortfall. Research on the development of new varieties and technologies 
a
re programmed to meet the present needs of the farmers.
 
All the state of the art technologies are used to propagate scientific 
technologies to farming community 
such as, 
village meetings, newspapers, 
radio, television, mass contact programmes, exhibitions 
and melas. The 
latest communication facilities like internet and mobile phones are used for 
disseminating the knowledge to farmers through web portals and short 
message services. Knowledge input on day to day market intelligence is 
updated for the benefit 
of the farming community. Location specific 
technology input imparted through training and on
-
 
farm demonstrations by 
Krishi Vigyan Kendras enable knowledge penetration to reach the 
unreached.
 
5.2 Agricultural Research Benefits 
 
           
Agricultural Res
earch activities are carried out in all the 11 colleges, 
36 research stations and 14 Krishi Vigyan Kendras. The outcome of the 
research is manifested by the release of (a) Twelve Varieties / Hybrids 
like,
 
65
 
 
TNAU Maize Hybrid CO 6, TNAU Sugarcane Si 8, TNAU C
oconut ALR (CN) 
3, TNAU Papaya CO 8, TNAU Coccinia CO 1, TNAU Bottle Gourd Hybrid 
CO 1, TNAU Ash Gourd Hybrid CO 1, TNAU Mushroom CO (TG) 3, TNAU 
Malai vembu MTP 1,Kufri Neelima potato, TNAU Blackgram VBN 7 and 
TNAU Coconut VPM 4. (b) Five Agricultural Imp
lements namely, Arecanut 
harvester, Tractor operated multipurpose hoist,
 
Improved coconut tree 
climber, Pulse Line Marker and Aerial access hoist for coconut harvesting 
and (c) Three Management technologies viz., Subsurface drip fertigation 
system, Biocolo
ur from beetroot and STCR based IPNS for agricultural and 
horticultural crops.
 
5.3 Research Programmes for upcoming years
 
High yielding, disease resistant varieties of rice, sorghum and cumbu 
varieties are being developed. Evolution of nutritionally superi
or ragi 
varieties with high calcium, zinc and iron content is under progress. 
Development of medium duration (130

135 days) and long duration (180 
days) redgram hybrids based on cytoplasmic genetic male sterile lines; 
development of high yielding varieties
 
of greengram and blackgram with 
synchronous maturity and resistance to mungbean yellow mosaic virus are 
in progress in pulses breeding. In oil seed crops, breeding for high oil and 
drought tolerant varieties in sunflower and groundnut are in progress.
 
 
 
I
ntegrated farming system is given the major thrust
 
area
 
for increased 
income generation to the farmers. To enhance the crop productivity and to 
improve the livelihood of the dryland farmers, precision farming technologies 
like,
 
summer ploughing, compartmen
tal bunding, broad bed furrow, sowing 
with the seed drill, intercultural operation, seed hardening and seed 
treatment, micronutrient 
are adopted.
 
These technologies are being 
implemented by imparting training to the dryland farmers. 
 
Technologies are being
 
developed to sustain the crop productivity 
under global warming situation. Technologies to enhance the water holding 
66
 
 
capacity in rainfe
d lands and to mitigate the mid
-
season drought will be 
identified. To overcome the labour scarcity, mechanization will b
e promoted 
to reduce the cost of cultivation and increase the profit.
 
Use of biofertilizer to supply various nutrients to the crop, use of 
microbes in value addition, research on bioenergy will be taken up. 
Establishment of model seed production demonstrat
ion farm will be taken 
up in identified districts. Seed production of pulses and oilseeds under 

efficiency and capacity building for seed entrepreneurs will be imparted.
 
Crop growth prom
oters such as Pulse wonder, Sugarcane Booster, 
Coconut tonic, Maizemax and Cotton plus will be popularized on a large 
scale for pulses, sugarcane, coconut, maize and cotton respectively.
 
Resource characterization of different categories of farmers on farmi
ng 
systems in Western and North western zones of Tamil Nadu, alternate 
cropping strategy as a contingent plan and agro
-
techniques for various 
situations in field crops, good agricultural practices aiming for better 
resource use efficiency, conservation agr
iculture in cropping systems will be 
optimized. High yielding and pest resistant vegetables will be screened.
 
 
Mechanization in rainfed farming will be given importance. Machines 
for land shaping, seed drills, plant protection equipments, harvesters etc., 
will be popularized among the farmers. Development of papaya hybrids with 
improved fruit quality and resistance to Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRSV) is in 
progress. Standardization of high density planting (HDP), Ultra High Density 
Planting (UHDP) and fertigat
ion practices will continue to assume 
importance in mango, banana and papaya.
 
Under the Environmental Sciences, the research focus will be on 
utilization of wastewater from paper mills, tanneries and distilleries for 
agriculture and other end users, utiliz
ation of solid wastes from agriculture, 
domestic and gelatin industries for organic manure production and utilizing it 
as organic inputs. Similarly, solid waste utilization from poultry litter towards 
67
 
 
organic farming, bioremediation of contaminated soils i
n different agro
-
ecolo
gical zones of Tamil Nadu. D
eveloping remediation technologies for 
improving salt affected soils and carbon sequestration and budgeting in 
plantations of fast growing trees will be taken.

Tamil Nadu Precision Farming Project is a State sponsored mega 
demo pr
oject implemented through Turnkey mode and is
 
spread over 
53,885 ha. Doubling o
f crop yield and high quality of farm output have 
created a revolution in vegetable cultivation.
 
Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative improves the productivity of water, 
land and labour, all at the same time, while reducing the overall pressure on 
water resour
ces. The technology package has been standardized. The yield 
increase is 60 to 90 tons per hectare.
 
Management of I
nvasive Papaya mealy
-
bug through parasitoid
 
Outbreak of papaya mealy bug, 
Paracoccus
 
marginatus 
was noticed 
during 2008 on papaya, mulberry, 
tapioca, jatropha, vegetables, fruits, 
cotton, plan
tation crops, spices and flower
 
crops in different parts of Tamil 
Nadu causing extensive damage going upto 90 
percent
. Management of this 
pest through classical biological control by importing parasitoid 
viz., 
Acerophagus papaya 
from USA through NBAII (National Bureau of 
Agriculturally Important Insects), ICAR, Bengaluru proved to be effective. So 
far, about 35 lakh parasitoids have been produced and released by TNAU in 
various parts of Tamil Nadu which ef
fectively controlled the mealy bug. 
 
5.4.4 Drip Fertigation in Red G
ram 
 
One of the ways of improving productivity of red gram is by growing it 
under controlled irrigation by using drip fertigation system. The technology 
has been standardized. The yield in
crease was from 1350
 
kg to 1850 
kg/ha.
.

Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries
 
 
 
6.1 Animal Husbandry
 
 
The animal husbandry and fisheries sector is very crucial role in the 
economic development particularly 
rural area.
 
The a
nimal husbandry and 
Fisheries sectors provide employment to a sizeable section of the rural folk 
to get income besides contri
buting to State income
. Their contribution to 
Gross State Domestic Product stood at 2.74 
percent
 
and to agricultur
e and 
allied activities
,
 
their contribution was 36.45 
percent
. 
Period
 
envisaged an 
overall growth rate
 
is to
 
6.7 
percent
 
per annum in livestock sector
 
during 
Eleventh Five year plan period
. 
 
 
6.2 Livestock Population
 
 
The Livestock Census helps to hammer o
ut formulation of rational 
policies for promoting farm practices and welfare schemes for livestock. The 
livestock population was 307.59 lakhs 
in 
Census 2007 as against 249.42 
lakhs in Census of 2004. The cattle and buffalo population increased from 
107.99 
lakhs in 2004 Census to 131.98 lakhs in 2007. The goat population 
in the State steadily went up between 1994 Census and 2007. Likewise, the 
poultry population leap frogged from 865.91 lakhs in 2004 to 1281.08 lakhs 
in 2007
,
 
registering an increase of 47.95
 
percent
. The state was ranked 
second in poultry population and egg production in the country. The share of 
total livestock population and poultry population in the State accounted for 
5.81 
percent
 
and 19.75 
percent
 
respectively in the all
-
India population
. 
Livestock Census details of the State are given 
in Table 6.1.
 
To augment milk production, breeding activities are being carried
 
out
 
intensively through Tamil Nadu Livestock Development Agency (TNLDA). 
The cattle population in the State increased from 90.47 lakhs (1997 Census) 
73
 
 
to 111.89 lakhs (2007 Census) which formed 36.38 
percent
 
of the total 
livestock population. Owing to the
 
State

activities, the exotic and crossbred population rose to 136 
percent
 
in 2004 
Census. However, the indigenous and native pure cattle population declined 
from 68.68 lakhs in 1997 Census to to 38.06 lakhs in 2007 Census.

6.3 Milk Production and Per Capita Availability
 
 
For the 
growing population and urbanization, increasing per capita 
income and cha
ng
ing consumption pattern, 
the 
need of the hour is to 
improve the milk production and per capita availability of milk in the State. 
The average increase in milk production in the Stat
e stood at 2.00 
percent
 
from 2006
-
07 to 2010
-
11 which was lower than that of 
the average at the all
-
India level (5.4 
percent
). The milk production witnessed a marginal 
improvement (2.04
 
percent
) from 66.51 lakh tonnes in 2008
-
09 to 67.87 lakh 
tonnes in 200
9
-
10. However, due to health care activities, it had further 
gone up to
 
68.31 lakh tonnes 
0.65 
percent in 2010
-
11
. As against the ICMR 
milk requirement of 250 gms. per day, the per capita availability of milk per 
day in the State improved marginally from 2
75 grams in 2008
-
09 to 278 
grams in 2009
-
10 and 
it marginally declined
 
to 269 gms. during 2010

6.6 Poultry Development and Egg 
Production
 
 
Poultry had undergone a transformation from backyard unit to the 
present vibrant and dynamic enterprise. There are eight Poultry Extension 
Centres and two Poultry Disease Diagnostic Laboratories functioning in the 
State for the development of p
oultry. The scientific breeding activities were 
carried on through these Poultry Extension Centres as a model farm in 
addition to providing technical advice to the farmers in the prevention, 
diagnosis and control of infection and parasitic diseases.

The poultry industry is more sustainable in the production hub districts 
of Namakkal, Salem
, Erode and Coimbatore. To protect the poultry from 
fatal Ranikhet disease, the State provided vaccination on specified days at 
the Veterinary Institutions and Sub
-
Centres weekly and in the camps under 
Kalnadai Padukappu Thittam
. Likewise, the State had pr
ovided two weeks 
vaccination drive against the disease during the month of February in the 
review years. As per Livestock Census 2007, the poultry population 
comprised 268.80 lakhs of backyard poultry and 1012.28 lakhs of 
commercial poultry. The poultry po
pulation increased by 47.95 
percent
 
from 
865.91 lakhs in 2004 Census to 1281.80 lakhs in 2007 Census. Of the total 
poultry population

6.7 Feed and Fodder Development
 
 
Feed and fodder are the major factors for enhancing farm animal milk 
production and yield rate. To increase the qua
ntity
 
and quality of livestock 
products like milk, egg and meat, good qu
ality and adequate quantity of 
green fodder is required. The cost towards feed and fodder accounts for a 
major share of 70 
percent
 
of the total production cost. Green fodder is not 
av
ailable throughout the year. H
ence, dry fodder, mash and pellet become a 
substitute for green fodder. 
 
 
As per 2007 (provisional) Livestock Census, the deficit of green fodder 
was estimated at 42.60 
percent
 
to total demand. However, dry fodder 
availability is adequate during normal monsoon period. The total area under 
fodder cu
ltivation increased from 680.27 hectares in 2009
-
10 to 1045.70 
hectares in 2010
-
11. The number of fodder seed production units incrased 
from
 
7 to 10 in the respective years. The production of fodder slips had 
come down from 190.96 lakhs to 177.87 lakhs dur
ing the respective years. 
Likewise, the production of fodder seeds also diminished from 2529 kgs. in 
2009
-
10  to 1773 kgs. in 2010
-
11.
 
However, the see
dlings improved from 
0.09 lakhs to 0.15 lakhs (66.67
percent
.
 
 
The distribution of fodder slips slided from 169.75 lakhs in 2009
-
10 to 
146.69 lakhs in 2010
-
11. Likewise, the seeds distribution decreased from 
400 kgs. to 360 kgs. in the respective years. The
 
distribution of seedlings 
had also declined from 0.083 lakh in 2009
-
10 to 0.025 lakh. The number of 
minikits distributed under Central Minikit Testing Programme (CMTP) 
decreased from 27619 to 20897.

6.8 Livestock Insurance
 
 
The centrally sponsored Livestock Insurance Scheme is being 
implemented in 15 districts of the State by the Tamil Nadu Livestock 
Development Agency. It aims to safeguard the farmers against the eventual 
loss of animals especially cattle and buffaloes. Unde
r the scheme, fifty 
percent
 
of the premium is provided as government subsidy and the rest is 
collected from the beneficiaries. The total number of milch cattle and 
buffaloes covered under insurance expanded from 89,649 numbers in 2009
-
10 to 92,589 numbers in 2010
-
11. The funds provi
ded for the scheme was 
Rs.600 lakhs and Rs.200 lakhs respectively during the years. During 2011
-
12
,
 
Rs.500 lakhs was earmarked for the scheme and proposed to be 
implemented in all the districts of the State. 
 
  
6.9 Fisheries
 
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the coast
al States in India in the east coast 
having a coastal line of 1076 kms. The State supplemented by 41,412 
sq.kms. of continental shelf, has 13 coastal districts with 591 fishing villages 
consisting of 8.92 lakh fishery population of which 
2.60 lakh fishermen 
(29
percent
) are actively engaged in marine fishing activity. Under inland 
fisheries, fishing population is at 2.21 lakhs in the State. Tamil Nadu 
occupies the third rank in fish production in the c
ountry.
 
6.9.1 Fish Production
 
 
Fish contains a great deal of protein and helps to contribute 
significantly to human growth and thereby assures nutritional security. The 
79
 
 
fish production consists of both marine and inland fish and fish products. Of 
the total
 
fish production, the marine fish production shared 71 
percent
 
and 
inland 29 
percent
 
during 2010
-
11. Likewise, of the marine fish production, 
the demersal varieties and pelagic varieties shared 55 
percent
 
and 45 
percent
 
respectively.
 
 
 
The total fish produ
ction marginally went up from 5.71 lakh tonnes in 
2009
-
10 to 5.97 lakh tonnes in 2010
-
11. Of this, marine fish production rose 
from 4.01 lakh tonnes to 4.25 lakh tonnes, the increase being 5.98 
percent
. 
Likewise, the inland fish production also marginally 
improved from 1.70 lakh 
tonnes to 1.72 lakh tonnes in the respective years. The total fish production 
of around 6 lakh tonnes in 2010
-
11 is estimated to contribute Rs.7860 
crores. The per capita production of a fisherman works out to Rs. 75000 to 
Rs.80000.
 
The per capita consumption of fish improved from 8.900 kgs. in 
2009
-
10 to 8.956 kgs. in 2010
-
11. The demand for fish increased due to a 
change in the consumption pattern of the growing population in the State. 
However, the fish resources in the inshore ar
ea had been over
-
exploited. 
Hence, there is a scope for off
-
shore resources which are yet to be tapped 
to the optimal level. To meet out the growing demand, the State took 
measures through Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation (TNFDC) 
for the conser
vation of fishery wealth and to manage resources for 
sustainable fish production. Apart from this, the National Mission for Protein 
Supplement (NMPS) was implemented with an allocation of 3.34 crores for 
the improvement of protein supplement to the populat
ion of the country. The 
State has taken steps to sustain fish production as well as to improve the 
socio
-
economic standards of the fishing community.
 
Of the total 13 marine fishing districts, Ramanathapuram alone had 
produced 86452 tonnes during 2010
-
11 which accounted for 20.4 
percent
 
of 
the total fish production, the increase being 4.9 
percent
 
over the previous 
year. The share of Nagapattinam and Thoo
thukudi accounted for 16.6 
percent
 
and 12.5 
percent
 
with a production of 70393 tonnes and 53188 
80
 
 
tonnes respectively.
 
The production in other districts
 
are Pudukottai (43757 
tonnes), Kanyakumari (42525 tonnes), Chennai (34283 tonnes) and 
Cuddalo
re (25532 to
nnes) in the State.

6.10 Fish Export
 
 
Fish is a rich source of foreign exchange. Tamil Nadu occupies a 
predo
minant position in fish culture. It 
is one of the major 
exporters of fish in 
the country. The fish export is carried on t
hrough Thoothukudi and Chennai 
p
orts in the State. The value of fish exported from Tamil Nadu is 30 
percent
 
of the value of its total production. The major fish varieties viz. frozen 
shrimp
, 
frozen cu
ttle fish, fresh fish, frozen squid, dried fish and others 
including chilled and live items are exported. The export of frozen shrimp 
accounted for a major share of more than 50 
percent
. The export of this 
variety improved from 37373 tonnes in 200
9
-
10 to 48556 tonnes in 2010
-
11, 
the increase being 30 
percent
. The total value of the export of frozen shrimp 
also accelerated from Rs.1984 crores to Rs.2150 crores in the respective 
years (Export value is Rs.572/kg.). Likewise, the total quantity of expo
rts of 
all varieties had gone up by 16.8 
percent
 
from
 
73773 tonnes in 2009
-
10 to 
86182 tonnes in 2010
-
11. The total value of fish export had witnessed a 
boost from Rs. 2000.55 crores to Rs.2860.19 crores during the years 
respectively. The State shared 10.6
 
percent
 
of fish exported and 26.2 
percent
 
of the value of fish exported in the country during 2010

Harvest Management and Value Addition
 
7.1 Post
-
harvest 
T
echnology
 
Post
-
harvest technology helps to meet the food requirements of 
growing population by eliminating avoidable losses 
in making more nutritive 
food items from low grade raw produce by proper processing and 
fortification
 
and by d
iverting a portion of food material as fodder to cattle by 
way of processing and fortifying low grade food and organic wastes and by
-
products into
 
nutritive animal feed. It has potential to create rural industries. 
In India, 
72.2
 
percent
 
of the population lives in
 
the villages and 
56.6
 
percent 
who 
depend on agriculture have experienced that the process of 
industrialization has shifted the food, feed
 
and fibre industries to urban 
areas. This process has resulted in capital drain from rural to urban areas, 
decreased employment opportunities in the rural areas, balance of trade in 
favour of urban sector and mismatched growth in economy and standard of 
l
iving including the gap between rural and urban people. It is possible to 
evolve appropriate technologies, which can establish agri
-
based rural 
industries.
 
The purpose of post
-
harvest processing is to maintain or 
enhance quality of the products and make it
 
readily marketable. Losses of 
food crops refer to many different kinds of losses produced by a variety of 
factors. These include weight loss, loss of food value, loss of economic 
value, loss of quality or acceptability and actual loss of seeds
ii
themselves
.
 
7.2 Food Processing and Post
-
Harvest Management Scenario
 
Augmentation of agricultural production needs a concurrent 
development of post
-
harvest support mechanism including normal and cold 
storage facilities, packaging facilities, agro
-
processing industri
es, crop 
sterilization and sanitation facilities and an effective marketing reach to 
global markets. Food processing adds value to the agricultural, horticultural, 
83
 
 
livestock and fisheries products by using various techniques like grading, 
sorting and packa
ging which enhance their shelf life. It leads to 
diversification of agricultural activities, improves value addition opportunities 
and creates surplus for export of agro food products. 
 
In Tamil Nadu, about 188 L.MT of fruits and vegetables are produced. 
D
ue to heavy post
-
harvest losses, there exists a considerable gap between 
gross production and net availability to the consumers. The post
-
harvest 
loss is estimated at 30 to 40 percent in fruits and vegetables
, which is 
primarily due to non
-
adoption of post
-
harvest management techniques
. The 
post
-
harvest losses start in the farm and travel along procurement chain and 
entire marketing channel. Adoption of post
-
harvest technology and growth of 
food processing industries are inter
-
related as post
-
harvest manage
ment 
increases the shelf life of fruits and veget
ables and feed more to the agro
-
processing industries. 
 
Factors contributing to the development of Food Processing Sector:
 

 
Vast source of agricultural/ horticultural raw material to food 
processing indutries
,
 

 
Transformation of
 
conventional farming to market
-
led commercial 
farming, 
 

 
Emerging domestic market in the form of large urban middle class 
with its changing food habits,
 

 
Change in consumption patterns driven by the processed food 
markets,
 

 
Government assistance for setting up and modernizing food 
processing units and creation of infrastructure, 
 

 
Increasing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in food business sector,
 

 
Conducive food processing policy environment and 
 

 
Availability of huge scientifi
c and research talent pool.
 
The current focus of research in food processing is to evolve 
technologies to reduce post
-
harvest losses, minimize it in processed foods, 
and evolve energy efficient and safe technologies for novel methods of 
preservation.  The 
introduction of new dairy, poultry and fish products, 
84
 
 
perceptible shift in eating habits and increase in income have resulted in a 
change in demand for the processed foods especially for animal products. 
 
 
7.3 Past and Current Trends in Food Processing Sec
tor
 
Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business is the State 
Nodal Agency for the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI), 
Government of India. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI
) 
decided to decentralize the implementation 
of food processing schemes in 
the Eleventh Five Year Plan period through banks/ financial institutions to 
provide a thrust and wider coverage for food processing industries in the 
country and simultaneously decentralize the procedures for appraisal, grant 
of assistance and monitoring standards.
 
 
Being a State nodal agency for MoFPI, the Department undertakes 
activities like: processes Projects on Food Industry, Entrepreneur 
Development Programme (EDP), Food Processing Training Centres, 
Seminars and Exhibiti
ons, Infrastructure for Food Processing Courses and 
Projects.
 
7.3.1 Food parks for processing
 
Food Parks
 
include food processing units such as fruits and vegetables 
processing, rice mill, flour mill, bakery unit, dairy products, milk products, 
animal feed, flakes and fast food. Besides State
-
of
-
the

art laboratory, hi
-
tech 
cold storage, captive power plant, ef
fluent treatment plant with all other 
ancillary facilities are mandatory for these parks. Farmers will get ready 
market for their produce and processing companies will get continuous 
supply of raw material. Food parks are poised to become catalysts for the
 
socio
-
economic development of the region. 
 
 
7.3.2 Agri Export Zones (AEZ)
 
With globalization and liberalization of Indian economy, international 
trade is playing a significant role in the growth of national and state 
economies. To increase the share of exports from Tamil Nadu, two more 
85
 
 
AEZs are to be promoted with modern pack ho
use and gamma irradiation 
facilities to control the incidence of pests and diseases and also to enhance 
the shelf life of farm produce. 
 
 
7.3.2 Terminal Markets
 
 
 
In order to encourage private investment for development of market
ing 
as well as value additi
on, t
he Department of Agricultural M
arketing and Agri. 
Business is m
aking efforts to establish modern terminal markets with all 
valu
e addition facilities in Public
-
Private Partnership (PPP) mode near metro 
areas of Chennai and Madurai districts.
 
7.3.4 Nati
onal Mission on Food Processing (NMoFP) 
 
The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has proposed to 
launch a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme (
CSS) in the ratio of 75:25 by 
Government of 
I
ndia
 
and State Governments.  During Twelfth Five Year 
Plan
,
 
t
h
e National Mission on Food Processing is to be implemented 
through States. The basic objectives are :  to augment the capacity of food 
processors working in unorganized sector  and upscale their operations 
through capital infusion, technology transfer, ski
ll upgradation and 
handholding support
. The
 
self
-
help groups working in food processing 
sector and facilitate them to emerge as Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SME) status to ensure the standards of food safety and hygiene to the 
globally accepted norms
. The
 
food processing industries 
is 
to adopt HACCP 
and ISO certification norms and to provide better support system to the 
organized food processing sector.
 
7.3.5 Food Technology and Value Addition 
 
The priority areas of food technology and value additions are 
research 
and development, quality control and capacity building. Research and 
development is needed to encourage both fundamental and applied 
research and keep abreast of global standards. Quality certification 
86
 
 
infrastructure in terms of labs and protocols
 
for quality certifications have to 
be upgraded to world standards. Following schemes are proposed on 
education and capacity building in food processing and to address the 
issues of paucity of chilling infrastructure for milk and milk products, lack of 
mod
ern slaughter houses, lack of value addition and infrastructure of 
fisheries export.

Summary
 
 
The First chapter
 
gives a brief introduction about Tamil Nadu. 
 
Tamil Nadu is the eleventh largest state in India by area and the 
seventh most populous state. It is the second largest state economy in India 
during
 
2012.
 
The State possesses varied types of 
agro
-
climatic conditions 
ranging from hot tropical through sub
-
tropical to temperate climate. 
Uneconomic size of a very large number of marginal and small farms, low 
economic status of the farmers and the low literacy level among farmers 
affect the full ad
option of scientific farming and hence the agricultural 
production. Large extent of land (about 24 lakh hectares) is considered as 
waste land in the State. This provides opportunities for land reclamation and 
development of horticulture and plantation crop
s in the State and acceptable 
adoption of Hi
-
Tech like precision farming.
 
The density of population is 555 
which 
is on the high
 
side 
and 
greater than the national average by about 
150 points. The population of the state is rising considerably
.
 
Performance and Challenges of Tamil Nadu agriculture has been 
discussed in Chapter Two. 
 
88
 
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the most socially developed and economically 
pr
ogressive States in the country. It is 
progressing faster in terms of per 
capita income and Human D
evelopment Indicators (HDI).

During 1996
-
97 to 2007
-
08, the average annual growth rate of GSDP 
of Tamil Nadu was 6.26 
percent and that of GDP of the country was 6.97 
percent. In comparative terms, growth rate of GSDP of Tamil Nadu has 
been more than the GDP growth in many years but the reverse is also true 
for some years. 
 
The structure of Gross State Domestic Product (GS
DP) in Tamil Nadu, 
has been shifting away from agriculture towards manufacturing and more 
towards services
 
sector
.  
 
The major crops like paddy, millets (coarse cereals), pulses, oil seeds, 
sugarcane and cotton are being raised in the State. These accounte
d for 60 
percent
 
of the total cropped area in the State during 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11.
 
Food grains constitute a vital source for the food and livelihood 
security. It accounted for 73 
percent
 
of the total crops in the State.  
Production and yield rate of food 
grains had recorded a negative growth of 
1.40 
percent
, 1.49 
percent
 
respectively during first four years of Eleventh 
Five Year Plan period. 
 
 
Chapter Three deals with the natural resource management of the 
State like   agro
-
climatic conditions, land use pa
ttern, water resource of the 
state.
 
89
 
 
Based on soil characteristics, rainfall distribution, irrigation pattern, 
cropping   pattern and other ecological and social characteristics, Tamil 
Nadu has been classified into seven agro
-
climatic zones. Due to increase
 
in 
population, urbanization and industrialization
,
 
the land put to non
-
agricultural 
uses marginally increased from 21.76 lakh ha. in 2009
-
10 to 21.77 lakh ha. 
in 2010
-
11. The cultivable waste and miscellaneous tree crops amounted to 
2.5 
percent
 
and 1.9 
pe
rcent
 
respectively in 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11. When 
compared to the previous year (2009
-
10), the cultivable waste marginally 
increased from 3.26 lakh ha in 2009
-
10 to 3.31 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11.
 
The cropping intensity has considerably increased over the years. 
C
ropping intensity i.e. gross area sown divided by net sown area was at 
1.18 during 2011
-
12 compared to 1.16 during the previous year 2010
-
11. 
 
The
 
results of successive agricultural census confirm the growing 
imbalance and asymmetry
 
in the distribution of 
the size of holdings.
 
The 
marginal and small farmers who constituted a higher proportion of 91 
percent
 
of the total farmers held a lesser extent of land holdings 
(59
percent
), whereas medium and large farmers who formed 2.3 
percent
 
of 
the total farmers poss
essed a larger chunk of 20 
percent
 
of land holdings.
 
Thus the distribution of landholdings is highly skewed. It is one of the 
causative factors for low productivity.
 
As per the new guidelines, the range of ceiling of Tamil Nadu has the 
limit of 24.28 hecta
res for dry land and for irrigated lands with two crops, the 
limit was 4.86 hectares, for irrigated lands with one crop
,
 
the limit is 12.14 
hectares.
 
The total surface water potential of the State is 24,160 MCM, including 
the contribution from neighbouring
 
states of Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala. 
Of the total water potential, the surface water potential of about 2.4 million 
hectares has almost been fully (more than 95 percent) tapped since the late 
sixties. Groundwater is, therefore, the only alternative sou
rce available for 
further development
 
90
 
 
The climate of Tamil Nadu is tropical in nature with little variation in 
summer and winter temperatures. While April
-
June is the hottest summer 
period (with the temperature rising up to the 40ºC mark), November
-
Februar
y is the coolest winter period (with temperatures hovering around 
20ºC), making the climate quite pleasant.
 
The State received an overall rainfall of 116.1 mm during 2010
-
11 
which was higher by 28.2 
percent
 
over the normal 908.6 mm. and 24 
percent
 
higher t
han that of the previous year 2009
-
10.
 
Details about farm inputs and management are explained in Chapter 
Four.
 
 
 
Seed is one of the important inputs to the agricultural development. 
The 
 
Department of Agriculture, Government of Tamil Nadu is playing an imp
ortant 
role in ensuring the seed quality and quantity from time to time through the 
Department of Seed Certification. The main functions of the Department are 
seed quality control, seed testing and conducting training schemes.  
 
In order to make available 
adequate quantity of quality seeds at right 
time to the farming community, the Department of Seed Certification is 
implementing Seed Certification, Seed quality control, Seed testing and 
Training schemes. Seed testing is being carried out to analyse the qu
ality of 
the seed lots. Factors like germination, physical purity, moisture, seed 
health and admixture of other distinguishable varieties are being analysed in 


ernment of India
 
The use of chemical fertilizers and their intensification in many areas 
are being reviewed and the Government is encouraging the application of 
appropriate fertilizers relevant to the soil and crops based on soil test 
recommendations. 
 
91
 
 
The
 
consumption of N,P,K in Tamil Nadu is found to be in the ratio of 
2:1:1 as against the conventionally accepted ratio of 4:2:1 indicating 
imbalance in the application of these three chemical nutrients. It is not only 
confined to the use of NPK but also nee
d based application of nutrients like 
sulphur, zinc, iron and boron which have become essential for exploiting of 
high yield varieties. The total application of chemical fertilizers had come 
down from 12.65 lakh tonnes in 2008
-
09 to 12.14 lakh tonnes in 20
09
-
10; 
however, it marginally improved to 12.29 lakh tonnes in 2010
-
11. The per 
hectare fertilizer consumption rose from 160 kgs in 2009
-
10 to 197 kgs in 
2010
-
11.
 
To increase crop productivity, balanced use of organic fertilizer is being 
advocated in the S
tate. Composting of farm waste using pleurotus 
vermicomposting, application of bio
-
fertilizers, green manures were 
popularized in the cropping system. In the State, for the promotion of green 
manure cultivation, 250MTs of green manure seeds were produced a
nd 
distributed with 25 
percent
 
subsidy. On the other hand, for the application of 
vermi compost, a financial assistance of Rs.1200/
-
 
per demonstration 
tota
l
ling 300 demonstrations was provided to conduct training to 15000 
farmers at a cost of Rs.11.55 lakh
s.
 
The biofertilizer packets are produced in six Biofertilizer Production 
Centres located at Cuddalore, Ramanathapuram, Salem Kudumiyanmalai, 
Sakkottai and Trichy and distributed through Agricultural Extension Centres. 
The bio
-
fertilizer production units (
Six Nos.) in the State have the capacity of 
producing 1660 M
T of 80 lakh packets comprising
 
200 gm. each per pa
cket. 
The area covered under bio
-
fertilizer increased from 2.87 lakh ha. in 2009
-
10 to 3.39 lakh ha. in 2010
-
11..
 
The irrigation intensity also i
mproved from 113.3 
percent
 
in 2009
-
10 to 
115.1 
percent
 
in 2010
-
11. The gross area irrigated to gross area sown had 
slightly gone up from 58.12 
percent
 
to 58.23 
percent
. Likewise, the net area 
92
 
 
irrigated to the net area sown witnessed a marginal increase fro
m 58.5 
percent
 
to 58.7 
percent
 
in the respective years.
 
The disbursement of institutional credit in Tamil Nadu, State 
Cooperatives, Rashtirya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Kisan Credit Card 
(KCC) Scheme and Agricultural Technology Management (ATMA) are some 
of the major programs through which credit has been made available to the 
farmers in the State.
 
Implementation of Crop Insurance Schemes in Tamil Nadu portrays the 
exemplary efforts taken by the State Government and Department of 
Agriculture by its resound
ing success among the farmers. The total number 
of farmers covered under the scheme improved from 9.41 lakhs in 2009
-
10 
to 9.65 lakhs in 2010
-
11. The total sum insured which was Rs.2740.9 crores 
had increased to Rs.3213.2 crores during the respective years
.
 
 
The status of agriculture research, education and extension of Tamil 
Nadu agriculture were discussed in detail in Chapter Five.
 
Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is spearheading its triple major 
activities of Education, Research and Extension converged
 
to work in 
synergy to bring forth 
Second Green Revolution
 
in agriculture. Research on 
the development of new varieties and technologies are programmed to meet 
the present needs of the farmers. The latest communication facilities like 
internet and mobile 
phones are used for disseminating the knowledge to 
farmers through web portals and short message services. Knowledge input 
on day to day market intelligence is updated for the benefit of the farming 
community. Location specific technology input im
parted th
rough training and 
on

farm demonstrations by Krishi Vigyan Kendras enable knowledge 
penetration to reach the unreached.
 
The Post
-
Harvest Technology Centre at TNAU is involved in 
developing food processing technologies and also providing training to rural 
m
en and women for working in processing units.

Tamil Nadu Agricultural University operates the Domestic and Export 
Market Intelligence (DEMIC) unit (www. tnagmark.tn.nic.in) and provides 
forecasts of
 
prices of agricultural produce
 
before sowing and also pri
or to 
harvest.
 
Chapter Six deals with the Animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries 
sector of Tamil Nadu.
 
The livestock population as per the  18
th
 
Quinquennial Census 2007 
was 307.59 lakhs as against 249.42 lakhs in 17
th
 
Quinquennial Census of 
2004. The share of total livestock population and poultry population in the 
State accounted for 5.81 
percent
 
and 19.75 
percent
 
respectively in the all
-
India population.
 
The milk production in the State witenessed a marginal improvem
ent 
(2.04
percent
) from 66.51 lakh tonnes in 2008
-
09 to 67.87 lakh tonnes in 
2009
-
10. However, due to health care activities, it had further gone up to 
68.31 lakh tonnes in 2010
-
11 by 0.65 
percent
. As against the ICMR milk 
requirement
s
 
of 250 gms. per day, 
the per capita availability of milk per day 
in the State improved marginally from 275 grams in 2008
-
09 to 278 grams in 
2009
-
10 and estimated to
 
be
 
269 gms. during 2010

percent
. Per capita availability of eggs in Tamil 
Nadu was 165 against the per capita availability of 53 eggs at all
-
India level 
in 2010
-
11.
 
In order to safeguard the farmers against the eventual loss of animals 
especially cattle and buffaloes
,
 
the centrally sponsored Livestock Insurance 
Scheme is being implemented in 15 districts of the State by the Tamil Nadu 
Livestock Development Agency.
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the coastal States in India in the east coast 
having a coastal line of 1076 kms. The 
state occupies the third rank in fish 
production in the country. The fish production consists of both marine and 
94
 
 
inland fish and fish products. Of the total fish production, the marine fish 
production shared 71 
percent
 
and inland 29 
percent
 
during 2010
-
11.
 
The 
state occupies a predominant position in fish culture and it is one of the 
major exporters of fish in the country.The total value of fish export had 
witnessed a boost from Rs. 2000.55 crores to Rs.2860.19 crores during the 
years respectively. The Stat
e shared 10.6 
percent
 
of fish exported and 26.2 
percent
 
of the value of fish exported in the country during 2010

Centres, Seminars and Exhibitions, Infrastructure for Food Processing 
Courses and Projects.
 
Food Parks
 
include food processing units such as fruits and vegetables 
processing, rice mill, flour mill, bakery unit,
 
dairy products, milk products, 
animal feed, flakes and fast food. Besides State

the
-
art laboratory, hi
-
tech 
cold storage, captive power plant, effluent treatment plant with all other 
ancillary facilities are mandatory for these parks. To increase the s
hare of 
exports from Tamil Nadu, two more AEZs are to be promoted with modern 
pack house and gamma irradiation facilities to control the incidence of pests 
and diseases and also to enhance the shelf life of farm produce. 
 
The Ministry of Food Processing In
dustries (MoFPI) has proposed to 
launch a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) in the ratio of 75:25 by 
GOI and State Governments to augment the capacity of food processors 
working in unorganized sector  and upscale their operations through capital 
infusio
n, technology transfer, skill upgradation and handholding support; to  
95
 
 
support  established self
-
help groups working in food processing sector and 
facilitate them to emerge as Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) status to 
ensure the standards of food safety
 
and hygiene to the globally accepted 
norms, to facilitate food processing industries to adopt HACCP and ISO 
certification norms and to provide better support system to the organized 
food processing sector.
 
Conclusion
s
 
The g
rowth of agriculture, as measured by the index of agricultural 
production is found to be moderate during 2010
-
11. Acceleration in 
agricultural production is essential to ensure food security, livelihood 
security, and nutrition security. 
A
gricultural sector
 
has to grow at a rate of 
4 
percent
 
annually considering the dynamic factors such as rising real 
per capita income, growing population and income elasticity of demand 
for food.
 
 
All the major crops such as paddy, cereals, food grains, sugar cane, 
cotton, o
il seeds, horticulture and sericulture had fared moderately. The 
irrigation management and intensive use of high yielding variety seeds, 
chemical fertilizer
s
, organic manure, bio
-
fertilizers and application of 
latest farm technologies
 
enabled
 
the performan
ce of agriculture to be 
encouraging. Despite this, the performance of agriculture sector is 
hobbled by diminishing average operational holdings, skewedness in 
distribution of farmers vis
-
à
-
vis number of operational holdings, and 
vagaries
 
of monsoon. Quantu
m of agricultural output heavily depends 
upon the occurrence of ideal spatio
-
temporal distribution of rainfall to a 
great extent. 
 
The share of principal crops and horticultural crops in g
ross 
c
ropped 
a
rea
 
has increased substantially during the last two de
cades
.
 
It 
proves 
that the process of diversification of agriculture towards high valued crops 
is in right direction, while there is a need for increasing the pace of 
96
 
 
diversification towards high valued cash crops in the state. National Food 
Security Missi
o
n (NFSM) and the National H
orticulture Mission (NHM) 
have also emerged as the path breaking interventions which have helped 
in agricultural diversification towards cash crops in Tamil Nadu. The 
growth in livestock in the state is also remarkable. 
 
 
The improvement in water use efficiency is urgently required for 
irrigation expansion and for reducing the excess pressure on ground 
water in water stressed areas of the state. More priority should be 
given 
to
 
rain water harvesting and effective water mana
gement through 
promotion of micro
-
irrigation methods.
 
So far as the increase in value of the agricultural output is concerned, it is 
noteworthy that the prices of agricultural commodities have increased 
successively over the years in the state resulting in
 
the rise in the value 
of output. However, the majority of farmers do not get remunerative 
prices because of constraints in marketing channels and infrastructures 
resulting in lower value for their output. 
 
 
Non
-
availability of workforce for agriculture du
ring season
 
 
 
This is indeed a
 
major
 
problem for a variety of reasons. The most 
important of
 
them are: (a) the increasing non
-
availability of local 
agricultural labour, which is largely being employed in 
Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee S
cheme and (b) the increasing 
bargaining power of the local and specialized labour. The 
MG
NREGS 
has now attracted most o
f the local agricultural labour
 
that prefer to work 
for the program related activities. The labour in the last few years has 
become incre
asingly powerful because of the increasing demand for 
them on the one hand and the
ir
 
bargaining power on the other
 
because 
of shortage of agricultural labourers
. This may escalate into a crisis in the 
97
 
 
future, unless some drastic attempts are 
made
 
by the go
vernment and 
labour associations to resolve the crisis. 
 
Lack of adequate post
-
harvest infrastructure 
 
There is a clear nee
d to increase the focus on post
-
harvest 
infrastructure, esp
ecially pack houses, cold storages
, refrigerated vans 
and market 
infrastructure. They have to be provided at the project site 
considering the special nature of exportable fruits and flower markets.
 
The marketing c
hannels are not well developed
 
The development of marketing channels has
 
to be 
undertaken
 
by 
the local, regi
onal and national governments on a wider scale throughout 
the country. Newer, modern marketing practices may be ushered in, with 
the encouragement and support of the government and even 
international funding organizations.
 
Strategies for Improving Marketin
g 
 
 
It is understood from the study that the farmers must have support in 
marketing their horticultural products and the strategies for improving 
marketing could be the following:
 

 

has to be na
rrowed;
 

 
A number of marketing practices can be encouraged but with focus 
on regulated   marketing; farmer 

consolidator 

 
trader 

 
commission agent 
-
wholesaler 

 
retailer 

 
consumer; markets 
regulated by marketing committees;
 

 
A model of transparent
 
cold ch
ains and linkage with farmers may 
be adopted;
 

 
There is need to provide infrastructure for local markets and help 
set up NDDB type markets; an
d
 

 
Different markets in one location may continue to provide 
competition.
