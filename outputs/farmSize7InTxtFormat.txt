With the fragmentation of land holdings, the average size of farms fell in the region, while the number of small-size holdings increased significantly. These small-scale farmers play an important role for food security and poverty alleviation. However, whether and how these small farms can survive under globalization is a hotly debated topic. In particular, the traditional claim that "small is beautiful," which is based on empirical observation that small farms present higher land productivity than large farms, is being challenged. It has been shown that a positive relationship also exists between farm size and labor productivity (and therefore income). To help these small farms prosper under increasing globalization, the governments have to change the "business as usual" attitude. Innovative land reform, for example, is crucial to secure property rights to farmers and to increase farm size. Equally important is the reform of public institutions in order to help small farmers to have access to credit, marketing, and technology. Moreover, promoting diversification in the production of high-value commodities can play an important role in raising the small-holders' income. Finally, policies that facilitate urban-rural migration and promote the development of the rural nonfarm sector are essential to help alleviate poverty among small-farm households and among the rural poor in general.

Farm Size, Productivity and Poverty in Asian Agriculture I. Introduction The debate on the relationship between farm size and productivity has gone through a complete circle. In the 1960s, it was perceived that small farms were efficient because they can fully use their resources, particularly family labor, and they can monitor their production activities closely. But in the 1970s and 1980s, as many Asian countries rapidly moved towards industrialization and urbanization, small farms were considered a major obstacle in this process. On the one hand, industrialization leads to demand for labor from rural areas, and this is in conflict with labor-intensive small farm practices. On the other hand by providing cheaper modern inputs such as machinery, industrialization made the increase in farm size possible by relaxing labor constraints during the peak season. Therefore, there was a call for larger size of farm in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s however, “the small is beautiful” view was once again revived. In the past decade, agricultural production has become more diversified into high value commodities, for example from grains to cash crop, from crop to livestock and horticultural products, in which small farms may have comparative advantages. Moreover, large size farms and input intensive practices (fertilizer, pesticides, machinery) have led to the degradation of natural resources and the environment. When these externalities are considered, large farms are no longer considered efficient. About 55% of the world's population lives in Asia, 58% of which depends on agriculture for a livelihood. However, the Asian region holds only 20% of the world's agricultural land. Moreover, the average size of holdings continues to fall in several ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==) countries of the region with the fragmentation of land holdings. Today, in most countries of Asia, the average land holding ranges only from 1 to 2 hectares, far below the world average of 3.7 hectares per person. At the same time, the number of small-size holdings increased significantly (Pookpakdi, 1992). As the world has become increasingly globalized, whether these small farms can survive under the new challenge is a hotly debated topic. The objective of this paper is to review the evidence between farm size and productivity, and between farm size and poverty, and to synthesize whether and how small farms can prosper under the increasing trade liberalization. This paper focuses on five Asian countries namely China, India, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. The paper is organized in five parts. Section II describes the changes in farm size over the past several decades and explores the reasons behind these changes. Section III reviews the level and the rate of change in production and productivity. The links among production growth, productivity, and farm size are explored in section IV. Section V assesses how small farmers can prosper under globalization and offers policy options on how government can help small farms to avoid adverse effects of trade liberalization and globalization. II. Changes in Farm Size. Farm size varies substantially among countries and has changed dramatically over the last several decades. Table 1 presents the average farm size and its change over time in China, India, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. 1 Small farms characterize the agricultural sector in the five Asian countries. In the early 1990s, the average farm size 1 The size and number of agricultural holdings are typically surveyed in agricultural census. To our knowledge, the latest Agricultural Census in Thailand and in India was conducted in 1993 and 1990/91 respectively. 2 in Thailand was the largest, at 3.36 hectares, compared with 1.55 hectares in India, and 1.37 and 1.23 hectares in Japan and South Korea respectively. The average Chinese farm was significantly smaller, averaging 0.43 hectares. The determination of farm size and its change over time is complex. This includes factors such as history, institutions, economic development, the development of non-farm sector (both in rural and urban areas), land and labor markets, and policies related to land tenure and property rights. Among these factors, land policy, institutions, and legislation have been the most influential. Immediately after World War II, drastic agricultural land reform was implemented in Japan. Land reform in Japan demolished a class structure based on landholding. Landlords were no longer supreme and rural society was restructured, so the rural population became supportive of the ruling conservative party. But land reform had little effect on agricultural production. Land ownership was transferred from landlords to tillers of the soil, and small tenant farmers became small owner-cultivators, with no apparent change in farm size. The traditional agricultural production structure from prewar Japan remained (Kawagoe, 1999). The year of 1961 marked a turning point in Japan’s agricultural sector with the passing of the Basic Law of Agriculture, which supported an expansion in the size of farms to balance farmers' incomes with those of city workers (Ukawa, 1995). Since then, several amendments to this law as well as various policies aimed at increasing the scale of farms have been passed, which promoted an increase in the size of farms (Kajii et al. 1988). The major reason for the slow increase in Japanese farm size is the heavy subsidies to agricultural production, artificially raising farmers’ income. High proportion of farmer’s 3 ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==) income from the nonfarm sector (82% in 2001, MAFF), together with extremely high land prices, further prevented the increase in farm size. In contrast to Japan, the average size of South Korean farm declined drastically after the World War II from 2.06 hectares in 1950 to 0.88 hectares in 1960. This significant drop in farm size in the 1950s was a result of the Land Reform Program, which marked the beginning of the modern agricultural system in South Korea. Prior to 1950, land was highly concentrated: a small number of landlords owned most of South Korean farmland. Most agricultural workers were tenants and paid rent to the landlords up to more than 50% of their gross revenue. With the Land Reform Program, the government established the maximum farm size at 3 hectares and bought any farmland in excess to that limit. In addition, the government procured farmland owned by non- farmers. The purchased land was redistributed to small or landless farmers (Kim, 1992). Since the 1970s, the total area of farmland has been declining in South Korea as a result of the increased demand for land by the non-agricultural sector. However, the decline in the number of farm households over the same period was greater (Kim, 1992). As a result, the average area per farm household increased marginally: the average farm size grew from 0.93 hectare in 1970 to 1.46 hectares in 2002. The average farm size has remained on average constant over time at around 3.4 hectares in Thailand for the past several decades. 2 Historically, the King owned all the land in Thailand. The concept of individual land ownership was introduced by the King Chulalongkorn in 1874 and by 1901 formal land title could be obtained. In 1975, the Parliament passed the Agricultural Land Reform Act, which aimed at distributing land 2 The review on Thailand’s land policy and institutions were heavily drawn from &lt;http://www.1upinfo.com/country-guide-study/thailand/thailand94.html&gt;. 4 owned by private owners to landless and tenant farmers. However the implementation of the reform was constrained by the military coups in 1976 and 1977. Although over 70 areas of the country were elected as Land Reform Areas by 1979, the Agricultural Land Reform Office was unsuccessful in acquiring land for redistribution as large landholders, wealthy aristocrats, businessmen and senior military officers opposed the designation of the Land Reform Areas. Today, many landowners still hold legal title to their land, and many farmers still lack legal title of ownership (1UPinfo – Thailand 2003 and Cabrera 2002). In contrast the trends in Japan and South Korea, the average farm size decreased in India and China. As shown in table 2, , the average farm size has declined from 4.81 acres to 2.5 acres in India in 1991 (Thorat, Hazell and Fan, 2003). But this average masks a large variation among different sub-groups and a dramatic change of size structure over time. The total number of rural households has almost doubled in India in the past four decades, from 63.5 million in 1953/54 to 116.4 million in 1991/92. Despite this huge increase, the number of landless households has hardly changed. There were 13 million landless households in 1991/92 (virtually unchanged from 14 million in 1953/54) and they accounted for only 11.2% of all rural households that year, down from 23.1% in 1953/54. In contrast, the number of landed households (owning greater 0.01 acres) increased dramatically (from 48.8 million in 1953/54 to 103.3 million in 1991/92), showing that despite rapid population growth, most of the additional rural households have been able to acquire at least a small amount of land. Of the landed households, the vast majority own 5 acres or less, and most of the increase in farm numbers has occurred among the sub-marginal and marginal households. Taken together, these two size 5 categories accounted for 68% of all landed holdings in 1991/92, up from 50% in 1953/54. At the same time the number of large farms (15 acres and above) has fallen, from 4.9 million in 1953/54 to 3 million in 1991/92. Many of these changes occurred most rapidly after 1981/82. The decline in the number of large farms suggests that much of the growth in the number of smaller farms may have resulted from the subdivision of large farms. This is confirmed by a parallel decline in the share of the total land area they own (from 52.5% in 1953/54 to 26.7% in 1991/92 (Thorat, Hazell and Fan, 2003), and hence in the average size of large farms (from 32.7 acres in 1953/54 to 25.5 acres in 1991/92. Despite the reallocation of land from large to smaller farms, the distribution of owned land has barely improved when measured by the Gini coefficient. This fell from 0.75 in 1953 to 0.71 in 1991, with all the change occurring between 1953 and 1960. This is because the increase in the number share of smaller farms about paralleled the increase in their land share. China experienced three major land policy and institutional reforms since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949. The land reform that was characterized by confiscation of land from landlords and redistribution equally to landless poor farmers was complete in 1953. This was soon followed by government efforts to develop large, collective operations and by 1956 most of China's agricultural production was done on a collective basis. Under this system, land ownership was vested in a collective that usually consisted of around 200 families. Beginning in 1958, the central government promoted an even larger scale of production in agriculture. Advanced cooperatives were merged into communes. At the height of the Commune movement in 1958/59, the average communal unit had grown to 5,000 households covering 10,000 acres. Virtually 6 all production means were owned by communes except for agricultural labor. The role of farmers during this period was to supply labor for commune production. Failures in the commune system, along with the three years great natural disaster (1959-61), led the government to implement an adjustment and consolidation policy after 1961. Production was decentralized into a smaller production unit called a production team — a sub-unit of the Commune consisting of only 20-30 neighboring families. By 1962, production teams had become the basic unit of operation and accounting in most of areas of rural China. For the rest of the pre-reform period, production was still organized by smaller-unit production teams, but was centrally controlled by the government. Farmer's income was not closely related to his production effort and virtually all input and output markets were controlled by the government. Any market transactions of major agricultural products outside of the procurement system were restricted. Market exchanges of land between different production units in the collective system were also outlawed. Due to the poor performance of the agricultural sector for more than two decades, in 1978 the central government decided to reform the rural areas. After two years of experiments, in 1981 the government began to decentralize agricultural production from the commune system to individual, farm households. By 1984, more than 99 percent of production units had adopted the Household production Responsibility System (HRS). Under the HRS, farmers have freedom of decision-making on major production and marketing activities, but they do not have ownership of the land allocated to them. Instead they have use rights and the collectives in theory still own land, or farmers in the same village jointly own land. Although the HRS contributed to rapid growth in agricultural production during the initial stage of reforms, land is fragmented due to equal 7 distribution of land to households on an egalitarian basis (i.e. based on household size and demographic composition). III. Agricultural Output and Productivity growth This section reviews output, land, labor and total factor productivity in Asian countries, serving as a background for the following sections to analyze the relationship between farm size and efficiency. Since 1961, output has grown the fastest in China (4.57% per year), followed by South Korea (3.39% per year), Thailand (3.25% per year), and India (2.93% per year). The worst performance in terms of output growth is found in Japan where agricultural output grew only by 0.58% per year over the period of 1961 to 2000. A close look at table 3 reveals different growth pattern over time for each country. There was a marked acceleration in the growth rate of agricultural output in India in the 1970s and 1980s (the so-called the green revolution period) relative to the 1960s followed by a slowdown during the 1990s (the reform period). On the other hand, output growth decelerated continuously in Japan from 3.23% per year in the 1960s to 1.36% in the 1970s, 0.88% in the 1980s, and continues its slide to a negative growth of -0.88% in the 1990s. For South Korea, agriculture output grew rapidly during the 1960s (5.3% per year) and 1970s (6.68% per year) but experienced a slowdown in the 1980s (3.27% per year) and the 1990s (2.47% per year). Similar to South Korea, output growth accelerated in Thailand from the 1960s (4.01% per year) to the 1970s (4.96% per year) but slowed down in the 1980s (2.41% per year) and 1990s (2.04% per year). 8 ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==) In terms of labor productivity, taken here to be the value of aggregate agricultural GDP (measured in 1995 U.S. dollars) per economically active agricultural population, Japan had the highest level and its labor productivity in 2000 of more than 30,000 US dollars (1995 constant US$) was 2.2 times higher than South Korea, 32 times higher than Thailand, 76 times higher than India, and 90 times higher than China. 3 There are marked differences in the pattern of labor productivity growth among the countries of study. Between 1961 and 2000, South Korea and Japan experienced the fastest growth in labor productivity with 4.72% and 3.80% per year respectively; the comparable figures for China, Thailand, and India were 2.64%, 2.38, and 1.31%. Labor productivity growth deteriorated continuously in Thailand from an annual average of 3.24% in the 1960s, to 2.58% in the 1970s, 2.50% in the 1980s, and 1.61% in the 1990s. After three decades of high growth, the rate of labor productivity growth dropped by half in Japan in the 1990s. In South Korea labor productivity grew at impressive rates of nearly 4% per year in the 1960s and 1970s, 8.4% in the 1980s and 6.15% in the 1990s. Finally, India and China encountered a slowdown in the labor productivity during the 1970s and the 1990s. Growth performance in land productivity provides a different picture (table 5). Over the whole period of study (1961-2000) land productivity grew the fastest in China at 2.89% per year, followed closely by South Korea, India, and Thailand while Japan experienced a dismal rate of 0.33% per year. China, India, and Thailand shared similar growth pattern: land productivity growth slowed down in the 1970s but accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s. After an increase in the land productivity growth in the 1970s, we 3 Higher labor productivity in Japan can be attributed to several factors: Higher mechanization, higher government financial support, and greater protection on agriculture by isolating domestic from international markets. The latter may not cause higher government budget, but it is rather a welfare transfer from consumers to producers. Since agricultural GDP is measured using the domestic prices, labor productivity may be lower when international market prices are used. 9 observed a decline in the rate of growth in South Korea in the 1980s and 1990s. In contrast, Japan showed an erratic growth pattern: land productivity growth declined in the 1970s, increased in the 1980s, and dropped significantly in the 1990s. Growth in total factor productivity is a ratio of total output growth to total input growth. It is a better measure of efficiency improvement because growth in total output and partial factor productivities can simply be achieved by using more inputs. TFP for India grew at an average annual rate of 1.75 percent between 1970 and 1995 (Fan, Hazell, and Thorat, 1999). In the 1970s, total factor productivity did not improved but it grew rapidly in the 1980s, at 2.52 percent per annum. Since 1990, total factor productivity growth in Indian agriculture has continued to grow, but at a slower rate of 2.29 percent per annum. Using district level data from India for 1970-1994, Fan and Hazell (2000) compare TFP growth between irrigated and high-low potential rainfed area. The authors found that TFP grew fastest in high-potential rainfed areas during 1970-94 (3.1% per year), followed by irrigated areas (2.21% per year) and the low-potential rainfed areas (1.58% per year). TFP growth has slowed in irrigated areas since 1990, remained unchanged at nearly 4% per year in high-potential rainfed areas, and accelerated to 3.06% per year in low-potential rainfed areas. In Thailand TFP grew at an average rate 1.27% per year during 1971-1981, but dropped by nearly 50% in the subsequent period covering 1981 to 1995 (Mundlak et al. 2002). For the whole period of study (1971-1995), TFP grew at an average rate of 1.08% per year. The major sources of TFP growth have been improved varieties of crops and changes in output composition. 10 TFP grew at an average rate of 1.09% in South Korea over the whole period of 1918-2000. The pattern of TFP growth varies markedly over time. From 1920 to 1960, TFP grew at a dismal rate of 0.09% per year (Park 2003). Various factors contributed to this low productivity performance including the colonization of South Korea by Japan (1918-38), the Second World War, and the South Korean War (Sharma, 1991). From 1960 to 1998, South Korean TFP grew rapidly at an average annual rate of 2.12% per year. Park estimated that productivity growth contributed to 52% of South Korean agricultural output growth over the 1918-2000 period. Productivity analyses in the Chinese agricultural sector typically distinguish between the pre- and the post- reform period. Beginning with the First Five Year Plan Period (1953-1957), during which large-scale land reform became was one of the priorities of the Communist government, TFP in Chinese agriculture increased steadily, as a result of institutional and technological changes (Fan, 2002). TFP declined by 13% per year during the Great Leap Forward (1958-60), following the establishment of the commune system. From 1961 to 1965 (Adjustment Period), Chinese agriculture recovered through a series of adjustments made by the government, and TFP grew by an annual rate of 4.7%. However with the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), production was centrally controlled by the government and executed by production teams. As a result of low incentives, agricultural production was inefficient and there were almost no gain in TFP. With the First Phase of Reform (1979-84), which was characterized by the decentralization of agricultural production system, TFP grew by 6.2% per year. Since 1984, agricultural prices and marketing systems were reformed and consequently, TFP continue to rise with an annual growth rate of 2.2%. 11 Over the last several decades, we observed a declining trend of growth rate in TFP in Japanese agriculture. The averaged annual growth rate was 2.82% from 1960 to 1968 but dropped to 1.11% in the 1969-1990 period. Kuroda (1997) attributed the sluggish growth rate in TFP after the late 1960s to a slowdown in technological progress. From this casual analysis, we observed that as average size of farm increased in Japan and South Korea, both land and labor productivities have increased, with a much faster growth in labor than land productivity. Moreover total factor productivity has shown a declining trend in Japan. On the other hand, in China, India, and Thailand, as farm size declines due to increased rural population, land productivity has increased much faster than labor productivity. In the case of China and India, TFP continued to increase. This all suggests that there might be an inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity and TFP, but a positive relationship between farm size and labor productivity. We will turn to literature that has done more rigorous analysis on these relationships in the next section. IV. Farm Size and Productivity: A Literature Review A popular stylized fact in development economics is that a strong Inverse Relationship (IR) exists between farm size and land productivity. Sen, in a seminal paper published in 1962, observed that small farmers were more productive per unit of land than large farmers. The IR is typically explained by the difference in factors endowments between small and large farms: by using family labor small farms face lower labor transaction costs than larger farms (Raghbendra et al. 2000, Berry and Cline 1979, Bhalla 1979). As a result, smaller farms have higher labor/land ratios and can achieve higher 12 yield per hectare (Feder, 1985). The IR has important implications for land policy as it entails that any type of land reform that reduces landholdings inequality will have a positive effect on productivity (Lipton 1993, Singh 1990). A significant volume of literature has been produced on the IR since Sen’s paper, however it has failed to reach a consensus. On the one hand, a body of literature supports the hypothesis that small farms produce more per unit of land than large farms (Heltberg 1996, Heltberg 1998). With the advent of the Green Revolution however, research has also shown that the relationship diminished or even reversed, as agriculture becomes more capital intensive. Although the IR has been studied in various countries, the literature has focused mostly on India. We review below empirical evidence on the farm size-productivity relation and discuss the factors that may explain the lack of consensus on this debate. The literature that clearly validates Sen’s findings include Mazumdar (1965), Bharadwaj (1974), Chaddha (1978), Ghose (1979), Bhalla (1979), and Carter (1984). Several explanatory factors on the IR have been advanced. Some supporters stress that differences in the intensity of land use across farms of different sizes influence land productivity. A typical example is the study by Cornia (1985). Cornia analyzed the relationship between factor inputs, yields, and labor productivity for farms of different sizes in 15 developing countries. In all but three countries (Peru, Bangladesh, and Thailand), a negative relationship was established between farm size and land productivity. Cornia attributed the higher yields observed on small farms to greater application of inputs and to a more intensive use of land. Similarly, Banerjee (1985) observed that smaller farms in the district of Nadia in West Bengal use their land and 13 fertilizer inputs more intensely than the larger farms. Banerjee took the analysis a step forward and showed that the cost per unit of output is directly related with the size of holdings, but inversely related with the value of output. This finding implies that small size farms are using their variable resources more efficiently than the bigger farms yielding to higher output per hectare. Environmental factors also appear to affect the farm size-productivity relationship. Tadesse and Krishnamoorthy (1997) examined the level of technical efficiency across agro-ecological zones and farm size in Tamil Nadu in 1992-93. The authors found significant differences in the level of technical efficiency among paddy farms across agro-ecological zones as well as size groups. Small and medium sized farms achieved a higher level of technical efficiency than those with large holdings. Moreover, the analysis revealed that small and medium sized paddy farms located respectively in the agro-climatic zones of Southern and Northeastern part of the state are operating at a higher level of technical efficiency than all other farms. With the transformation of agriculture towards a science-based approach, family labor became less important in shaping land productivity while other inputs such as fertilizer played a greater role. Following the Green Revolution, farms relied increasingly on purchased inputs and capital. As these inputs require cash and credit flow, they are clearly more accessible to farmers with large landholdings. Opponents of IR hypothesis argue that the earlier adoption of new technology by large farmers have reduced or even reversed the yield advantage of small farmers. Deolalikar (1981), for example, found that the inverse size-productivity relationship cannot be rejected at low levels of agricultural technology in India, but can be rejected at higher levels. This finding suggests that 14 although the IR remains valid for a traditional agriculture, it cannot be assumed to exist in an agriculture experiencing technical change. Similarly, Chattopadhyay and Sengupta (1997) found that the IR between farm size and productivity were stronger in agricultural developed regions of West Bengal compared to the relatively less developed regions. Hanumantha (1975) and Subbarao (1982) also found a positive relationship between farm size and productivity and attributed this positive association to higher application of fertilizer and other cash-intensive inputs on large farms. Bhalla and Roy (1988) suggested that the inverse relationship might be a result of differing land fertility between small and large farms. Using a comprehensive dataset with observations including 21,500 farm households from different parts of India, Bhalla and Roy confirmed the IR at the state level. However, when incorporating soil quality variables and running the regressions on more disaggregated geographical units, the authors observed that the IR weaken and in many cases disappeared. The authors concluded that the stylized fact of a negative relationship between farm size and farm productivity might in large part due to the omission of soil quality variables from the estimated equations. Similarly Carter (1984) found that intra-village soil quality differences and other farm assets explain part of the size-productivity relationship in Haryana. On the other hand, Newell et al (1997) argued that in Gujarat the IR is an interregional phenomenon: farms tend to be smaller in fertile regions and larger in less fertile regions. The authors also observed that labor per hectare is higher on small farms. Thus the IR between output per hectare and farm size is explained by regional variations in fertility and labor supply. 15 Managerial factors appear to have an influence on the IR. Rao and Chotigeat (1981) econometric results showed that when hired labor is employed in preference to family labor and nontraditional capital as opposed to traditional capital is used, large sized holdings are positively related with higher productivity. Farm size is typically defined in terms of the physical size of the operational holdings. According to Sampath (1992), this conventional way of defining farm size leads to biased estimates and misleading inferences as it fails to discriminate between irrigation and non-irrigated areas. By adding the two types of land to define total area, one implicitly assumes that one unit of irrigated land has the same cropping intensity potential than one unit of non-irrigated land. Sampath demonstrated that using the conventional definition of farm size in the regression equation leads to biased estimates resulting in the misleading inference that there are diseconomies of scale in the use of land. In contrast using with the same dataset, the author found that there are no diseconomies of scale in land use when making discriminating between irrigated and non-irrigated land in the econometric specification. V. How Small Farms Can Prosper Under Trade Liberalization The past literatures had a fantasy about the efficiency of small farms. It is true that small farms are efficient in terms of land productivity. However, as demonstrated above, the relationship between farm size and labor productivity is not clearly established. In fact, many empirical evidence support a positive relationship between farm size and labor productivity (e.g. Cornia, 1986). As shown empirically and theoretically, labor productivity is essential to raise farmer’s income. 16 Labor productivity in agriculture can be decomposed into two components, i.e., land productivity and land to labor ratio: Y/L = Y/A*A/L, Where Y is output, L is number of agricultural workers, and A is total land area available to agricultural production. To increase labor productivity, and therefore farmers’ income, either land productivity has to increase or land to labor ratio has to improve. This is a daunting task as the number of small farms is still large and continues to increase over time. For example, the proportion of farms below one hectare rose from 50.6% in India in 1970/71 to 59.4% in 1990/91, while the share of the larger farms decreased from 3.9% to 1.6% over the same period. Farms of less than 2 hectares constituted 78% of the total number of farms in India but contributed nonetheless to 41% of the national grain production. The Chinese agricultural sector is still predominated by very small farms with less than 1 hectare of land: 83% of Chinese farms in 1997 were less than 0.6 hectares while only 0.24% of farms were bigger than 6.6 hectares. Large percentage of these small farms is under poverty (Fan, Hazell, and Thorat, 1999), and they constitute more than half of the nation’s totals of hungry and poor in India (Singh et al, 2002). To get the small farmers out of the “efficient but poor” trap, appropriate polices should be carefully designed. Reforming Land Polices and Institutions The success of land reforms in Asia has been mixed. Since its independence, India has implemented land reform. Primarily, India’s reforms consisted of introducing new regulations that place a ceiling on agricultural land, restrict leasing, regulate rents, 17 and provide security of tenure, but the implementation has varied by region. At the present, more than 10% of agricultural workers still do not have land, and for landed farmers, a large proportion has extremely small size, which is not sufficient to support the farm family. The radical approach used by China and South Korea in the 1950s is not politically feasible anymore for India. It is imperative for the government to design and implement an innovative approach to promote a more efficient and equitable land policies and institutions. On the other hand, the Chinese land tenure system provided equal access to land, which has avoided a large number of rural landless poor, and also increased efficiency of production during the initial stage of the reform in the 1980s. Unfortunately, the current system does not provide a permanent ownership for farmers. This has hindered further development of agriculture and rural areas. For example, farmers cannot use land as collateral for accessing credits. It also prevents the increase of farm size because farmers only have the right to use – but not to own – their land. The newly proposed Land Lease Law in the beginning of 2003 will allow farmers to sell and buy land use rights at the market prices without interferences of local villages and governments. But the legal framework to implement this policy is yet to be established. On the other hand, this new law may also increase the concentration of land and lead to large landless farmers or migrants in the urban centers. Without a sound social safety net, these landless will fall into the poverty trap. Reforming Public Institutions to Serve Small Farms 18 In many Asian countries, small farms are still ignored by the government. For example, due to their limited land, it is difficult for small farms to access credit, marketing and technology services. Given that agricultural research investment in the past has also been biased against small farms, it was not surprising that the large farms adopted the green revolution technology first, followed by small farms later. Small farms were often losers in the initial adoption stage of a new technology since prices of the agricultural products were pushed down by greater supply of products from large farms resulting from the new technology. To avoid losses for small farms in this initial stage, government may have to consider using limited targeted subsidies on credits, inputs and new technologies to small farms. Once the new technology has been adopted, the subsidies should be removed gradually to avoid efficiency loss in the future. Development of High Value Commodities Given the small size of farm holdings and limited labor movement out of the agricultural sector, land productivity must increase to increase labor productivity and farmers’ income. However, due to natural constraints, the potential to increase yield in traditional crops such as rice, wheat, maize, cotton, and rapeseeds is limited. In addition, international prices of these products are low due to over supply and heavy protection from the developed countries. A possible solution is for farmers to diversify their farming activities and to engage in production of high value commodities. The government has much to do to facilitate this process. First, the government must change its funding priorities in agricultural research from traditional crops such as rice and wheat to cash crops, livestock, and post-harvest 19 technologies. It is still the case that many developing countries spend more than half of their agricultural research expenditures on staple crops (Fan, Qian and Zhang, 2003). Second, the government should gear up its public investments or should design public policy to attract private investment in transportation, retail chain stores, processing and storage. At the present, the governments spend a great proportion of its public investments in traditional activities such as irrigation and large crop extension programs. Migration Lack of economic and employment opportunities lead to migration either to urban areas or rural areas in other parts of the country. During economic booms in Japan, South Korea, and lately China and Thailand, rural-urban migration not only improved the well- being of the migrants, but also improved land/labor ratio in the agricultural sector, enabling non-migrants to raise their labor productivity and income. For example, the increase in land/labor ratios in Japan and South Korea, and more recently in China was the result of net flow of rural labor to the urban and rural nonfarm sectors. However, today there are still formal and informal institutions and policy barriers to restrict these movements. Lack of education and access to information and infrastructure is the most critical constraint. In China, many jobs in the urban areas still require urban residence and farmers are not eligible for these jobs. Even if farmers are employed, their rights are usually not protected. In addition, the social services such as healthcare, education of children, retirement and unemployment benefits which the urban residents are entitled are non-existent to migrant farmers. All these restrictions and barriers should be removed to make large-scale migration possible. 20 Development of the Rural Nonfarm Sector. Expanding off-farm employment is important for poverty alleviation. Hazell and Haggblade (1993) showed that the share of household nonagricultural income is inversely related to farm size, with landless and near-landless workers deriving between a third and two-third of their income from off-farm sources. In India, Dev (1986) indicated the bulk of poor are landless or lives on small farms with inadequate land for their own food need. Consequently they depend heavily on earnings from supplying unskilled wage labor to other farms or to non-farm enterprises. Moreover public investment in physical infrastructure (road, transportation, communication) as well as in education and health is crucial for the small farms to establish their own business and to access non- farm jobs in the rural non-farm sector. 21 Bibliography Banerjee, B.N. 1985.

Also, whereas agricultural productivity is positively influenced by Gender (male farmer), household size, extension contact and use of improved seed varieties, its relationships with educational level as well as quantities of fertilizer, herbicide and farm size are mixed (Fan and Chan-Kang, 2005; Kelly, 2006; World Bank, 2007; Tittonell, 2007). " [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] **ABSTRACT:** In spite of the economic importance of maize, its productivity is still low in Ghana. This study examined the economic efficiency and productivity of maize farmers to shed light on the causes of low productivity of maize in Ghana. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to collect cross-sectional data from 576 maize farmers in eight districts in four agro ecological zones of Ghana. Multinomial logit model and the stochastic frontier production function were the methods of analyses adopted in addition to descriptive statistics. The study revealed that an increase in educational level, credit, extension contact, experience, price of maize, group membership and ready market would increase use of maize productivity enhancing technologies. Also, fertilizer, pesticides, manure, herbicide, seed and land inputs were found to be positively related to maize output. With technical efficiency scores of 61.2%, 70.2%, 49.9% and 66% for maize farmers in the northern savannah, transitional, forest and coastal savannah zones respectively, it is most economical to produce maize in the transitional belt of Ghana. Generally, educational level, experience, income, extension contact, male gender, group membership, credit, household size, ready market as well as use of fertilizer, pesticides and improved seeds would increase the technical efficiency of maize farmers in Ghana. Whereas fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, manure and land were underutilized by farmers, capital was over utilized. The scale efficiency analysis revealed that the overall mean scale efficiencies were 85.7%, 90.9%, 88.6% and 85.5% for maize farmers in the northern savannah, transitional, forest and coastal savannah zones respectively. Generally, it can be concluded that an increase in educational level, experience, access to good roads, extension contact, household size as well as use of fertilizer and improved seeds would increase the scale efficiency of maize farmers in Ghana. Policies aimed at addressing the efficiency challenges of maize farmers in Ghana should be targeted more at improving technical efficiency.

Examining agricultural land use and the relevant policy issues from this viewpoint has important policy implications not only for Japan but also for other emerging Asian economies, in which agriculture is losing its comparative advantage due to economic growth under meager factor endowments for crop production (Fan and Chan-Kang, 2005; Otsuka, 2013). The difficulty faced by analysts trying to understand agricultural land use realignment in post-industrial countries lies in isolating the contribution of countervailing processes in the context of long-term structural decline. " [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] **ABSTRACT:** Japanese agriculture has stagnated since the late 1980s, setting in motion a steady process of farmland readjustment. The notable consequence is an increase in the number of people who quit working on the land and a concurrent decline in cultivated farmland, a process which is often balanced by the development of land rental markets. However, since the total areas of rented land and abandoned farmland have increased in parallel, the contribution of land rental as a countervailing force may be underappreciated. And indeed, a cross-sectional observation paints quite a different picture: a negative correlation between the land rental ratio and the farmland abandonment ratio at the prefecture level. Our econometric analysis suggests that it is not so much farm households but rather non-farm household entities that are deeply involved in the appearance of this relationship over the past two decades. In particular, non-farm household producers play an important role as lessees not only by facilitating land market development but also by preempting farmland abandonment. Land- holding non-farm households, another relevant group of actors, are significant contributors to the supply side of farmland but their land also accounts for around half of the total abandoned area. Our analysis also offers unambiguous evidence that a former institution, namely Landholding Corporations, serve an intermediary role in facilitating the exchange of land use rights. However, although these corporations were expected to help reverse farmland abandon- ment, the limited resources granted by the government tend to make them averse to the kind of risky transactions that are often associated with promoting neglected or unfavorable land.

The free-availability and systematic global acquisition of Landsat 8 data indicate an expected need for global coverage and so computationally efficient Landsat 8 pansharpening. This study adapts and evaluates the established, and relatively computationally inexpensive, Brovey and context adaptive Gram Schmidt component substitution (CS) pansharpening methods for application to the Landsat 8 15 m panchromatic and 30 m red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands. The intensity images used by these CS pansharpening methods are derived as a weighted linear combination of the multispectral bands in three different ways using band spectral weights set (i) equally as the reciprocal of the number of bands; (ii) using fixed Landsat 8 spectral response function based (SRFB) weights derived considering laboratory spectra; and (iii) using image specific spectral weights derived by regression between the multispectral and the degraded panchromatic bands. The spatial and spectral distortion and computational cost of the different methods are assessed using Landsat 8 test images acquired over agricultural scenes in South Dakota, China, and India. The results of this study indicate that, for global Landsat 8 application, the context adaptive Gram Schmidt pansharpening with an intensity image defined using the SRFB spectral weights is appropriate. The context adaptive Gram Schmidt pansharpened results had lower distortion than the Brovey results and the least distortion was found using intensity images derived using the SRFB and image specific spectral weights but the computational cost using the image specific weights was greater than the using the SRFB weights. Recommendations for large area Landsat 8 pansharpening application are described briefly and the SRFB spectral weights are provided so users may implement computationally inexpensive Landsat 8 pansharpening themselves.
