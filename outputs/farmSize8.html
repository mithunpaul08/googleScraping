	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content=" The study describes the assessment of mobile phone based agricultural voice messages disseminated to farmers of Cauvery delta zone in Tamil Nadu, India, during September, 2012 to June, 2013. The present study was conducted in July, 2013 for about 20 days period through telephonic interview using a well structured questionnaire with randomly selected 200 farmers across five districts (Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Thiruchirapalli, Thiruvarur and Cuddalore of Cauvery delta zone in Tamil Nadu, India). The survey results showed that majority of the farmers have adopted the agricultural information disseminated through their mobile phone. In addition, Chi square analysis showed that the farmers with irrespective of socio economic characteristics such as gender, age, education, land holding and farming experience have adopted the agricultural information. More than half of the farmers had expressed that either all or most of the agricultural information were useful. Majority of them had expressed the information received on their mobile phone were trust worthy. With reference to satisfaction level of farmers, almost all the farmers were very satisfied with audio quality, simplicity of language and contents of voice messages. Majority of the farmers’ have indicated that the mobile voice messages were of better as compared to other sources of information that they were accessing .  "/>

        INTRODUCTION
      </h3>
      <p>
        Enhanced farm productivity and farmers' livelihoods
        largely depend on how the relevant technology information
        and farm inputs are accessed by farmers. Singh (2011)
        reviewed various delivery mechanisms of agricultural
        extension services available to farmers in India. This
        study showed that an innovative approach towards farmers
        was practiced during the Green Revolution period for
        disseminating agricultural information to farmers in
        India. However, this approach had facilitated only
        resource rich and irrigated land holding farmers in
        utilizing the Government support while small and marginal
        farmers were not able to be part of this extension model.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the earlier practice of extension, farmers were
        contacted on a one to one basis, which had been a very
        effective but an expensive and unsustainable practice.
        Another approach was the farmer field school which
        consisted of schools without walls where groups of
        farmers met periodically with facilitators during the
        crop season. An important learning from the farmer field
        schools was that of sustainability without outside
        funding sources. Singh further emphasized that a new
        approach using Information and Communication Technology
        for the dissemination of agricultural information that is
        relevant and reliable needs to be developed to achieve a
        real impact on farm productivity and livelihoods.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the National Sample Survey, only 40 per cent
        of the farmer households accessed information about
        agricultural techniques and inputs (NSS, 2005). Farmers
        access information from progressive farmers, input
        dealers, mass media, public extension workers,
        cooperatives, output buyers/processors, Government
        demonstrations, village fairs, study tours, Krishi Vigyan
        Kendras and private companies. But, the most important
        sources of information are progressive farmers, input
        dealers and mass media (Surabhi and Gaurav, 2009; Surabhi
        et al. 2010; Ashutosh et al. 2012). , ICT in different
        forms has been widely taken up in India by various local
        or national non-governmental organizations followed by
        private and public sector agencies (Saravanan, 2010), as
        a tool to disseminate agricultural information amongst
        farmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mobile application plays a key role in fulfilling the
        agricultural information needs of the farmers as it has
        many advantages such as easy and convenient access, reach
        to areas where there is no other ICT infrastructure like
        internet, fixed lines etc., and is easily afforded by
        farmers (Ravinder and Vister, 2010). According to the
        Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the number of
        wireless mobile phone subscribers has reached 867.80
        million as on March 2013 and India is the second largest
        wireless market in the world (TRAI, June, 2013). Further,
        rural subscribers are continuously increasing every
        month, as compared to urban subscribers. The increasing
        trend in mobile phone use, particularly in remote rural
        areas, provides an opportunity to bridge the rural and
        urban digital divide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several mobile phone based agricultural extension
        projects have been deployed in India like, aAqua (Krithi
        et al. 2011), Avaaj Otalo, (Patel et al. 2010), mobile
        digital video (Rikin et al. 2009). Similarly, IFFCO Kisan
        Sanchar Limited (IKSL), BSNL, Reuters Market Light (RML),
        Nokia Life Tools, Fisher Friend Project, Rubber Board and
        Department of Agriculture, Haryana State provide services
        through SMS and Voice messages containing agriculture
        related information like market price, weather updates,
        news on agricultural policies and best agricultural
        practices (ICTFSECBP, 2009; Fafchamps &amp; Minten, 2012;
        Saravanan, 2010). The Department of Agriculture,
        Government of Tamil Nadu, in collaboration with IITM's
        RTBI has been disseminating agricultural information to
        farming communities of five delta districts, through
        voice messages delivered on farmers' mobiles. For the
        farmer, the costs of the service are zero, as the
        messages, delivered as incoming voice calls, are free for
        farmers.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        Dissemination process of mobile voice messages on
        Agricultural Information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Figure 1 presents the dissemination process of mobile
        based voice messages containing agricultural information.
        The agricultural extension officials of the Department of
        Agriculture, in the state are responsible for preparing
        the content of agricultural information, while Uniphore
        Software Systems (the technology partner in this
        initiative and a company incubated by RTBI) is
        responsible for developing and dissemination of
        agricultural information to farmers' mobile number
        through voice messages. Information was sent on a monthly
        basis and the message duration lasted for a maximum of
        one minute. The messages were relayed during August, 2012
        to July, 2013. From the call records, it was found that a
        total of 3,833,650 voice messages with an average of
        three to four messages per month per farmer were
        delivered to 123756 farmers- the messages contained
        agricultural information covering various aspects such as
        fertilizer application, pesticide application, best
        agricultural practices, seed varieties, insurance and
        government schemes. The analysis of the voice messages
        revealed that a large percentage of messages were on
        Government schemes (29.53%) followed by best agricultural
        practices (23.36%) and fertilizer application (23.36%).
        Table 1 presents the category of information disseminated
        through mobile voice messages to the farmers.

        METHODOLOGY
      </h3>
      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        The Study Area
      </h3>
      <p>
        The study was carried out in five districts of Cauvery
        Delta zone namely Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam,
        Cuddalore and Tiruchirapalli of Tamil Nadu, India (Figure
        2). The study area lies in Cauvery delta agro climatic
        zone. It lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu between
        10&ordm;-11&ordm;30' North latitude and between
        78&ordm;15' - 79 &ordm; 45' longitudes. The total
        geographic land area of Cauvery delta zone is 14.47 lakh
        ha, which is equivalent to 11.13 per cent of the Tamil
        Nadu geographical area. This area experiences an average
        annual rainfall (mean) of 1078 mm and most of the
        rainfall is received during the North East monsoon
        season. Rice is the principal crop being grown here and
        the next important crops are pulses such as black gram
        and green gram, being grown as rice fallow crops.
        Vegetables like brinjal, chillies and greens are also
        being grown in a limited area in the well-drained fertile
        lands, depending upon the underground water source. In
        light clay loamy soils under garden land condition crops
        like groundnut, maize, gingelly and irrigated pulses are
        grown. Banana, sugarcane and ornamentals like jasmine,
        rose, chrysanthemum, crossandra and nerium are the
        annuals being grown. Coconut gardens, bamboo and wood
        lots are found scattered in the delta in different
        densities. Mangoes, Jackfruits, citrus of various kinds -
        guava, pomegranate and custard apple etc., are also being
        grown in specific pockets.

        Sampling Procedures and Sampling Size
      </h3>
      <p>
        All the five districts of Cauvery delta region were
        selected for the study because all the registered farmers
        in these districts receive and participate in the mobile
        based voice messages initiative. The districts are
        Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruchirappalli, Thiruvarur and
        Cuddalore. This is followed by a convenient sampling of
        40 farmers from each of the districts, forming a sample
        size of two hundred (200) farmers, for the study.
      </p>
      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        Data Collection and Variable Measurement
      </h3>
      <p>
        The primary data for the study was collected from the
        farmers through telephonic interview using a
        well-structured questionnaire, while the secondary data
        was obtained from journals, conference proceedings,
        internet etc. The farmers considered were those who had
        already registered their mobile number at
        http://www.tnagrisnet.tn.gov.in/website/index.php run by
        the State Department of Agriculture, Government of Tamil
        Nadu. The registered mobile numbers of the farmers were
        collected from the technology partner (Uniphore Software
        Systems, Chennai). The socio-economic characteristics of
        the respondents such as gender, age in completed years,
        education attainment in the form of primary school,
        middle school, high school, higher secondary school,
        graduate and post graduate, land holding size classified
        as marginal farmer (those who have &lt;2.50 acres), small
        farmer( those who have 2.51 - 5 acres), medium farmer
        (those who have 5.01 - 12.50 acres) and large farmer
        (those who have 12.51 acres and above) as well as
        individual farming experience of the respondents were
        collected. The farmers were requested to inform about
        current sources from where they get agricultural
        information. This question was asked to compare the
        sources of information with the delivery of agricultural
        information via mobile phone through voice messages.
        Following this, the farmers were asked whether they
        adopted any of the information that was delivered through
        mobile voice messages. The farmers' perception of
        usefulness of voice messages was also captured (all of
        the messages were useful, most of the messages, few of
        the messages, and none of the messages were useful).
        Level of satisfaction over mobile based voice messages
        with regard to audio quality, simplicity of language and
        content of the voice messages was measured (Very
        satisfied, satisfied and not satisfied) and finally they
        were asked to answer whether the information that they
        received through their mobile phone were same or better
        than that of the current sources of information which
        they were accessing.

      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        Data Analysis
      </h3>
      <p>
        Data collected for the study were analyzed with the use
        of simple descriptive analysis (frequency and
        percentages) and inferential statistic (Chi-square) using
        SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences).

        RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
      </h3>
      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        Socio-economic characteristics of the farmers
      </h3>
      <p>
        Analysis of the farmers' socio-economic characteristics
        was carried out and the summary of the result is
        presented in Table 2. Majority (91%) of the farmers were
        male while only few (9%) of the farmers were female. The
        higher proportion of male farmers could be due to the
        fact that most male farmers were primarily responsible
        for doing farming while females were assisting the males
        in most of the farming activities apart from doing other
        work such as manual transplanting, weeding and attending
        to value addition activities for their agricultural
        commodities. This might be because of the gender division
        of labour based on their cultural background as well as
        prevailing norms and values of the people living in the
        study area. This finding is in agreement with the report
        of Xiaolan and Shaheen (2012) who stated that the farming
        occupation was usually dominated by males though they
        were assisted by their female counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data on age of the farmers shows that 44.00 per cent
        of the farmers were 46 years and above, 37.00 per cent of
        them fell within the age group of 36 - 45 years and
        finally 19.00 per cent of the farmers were below 35
        years. This finding implies that most of the respondents
        were within the active age group of 45 years and below.
        Age factor was found to be significant in agricultural
        information accessibility and utilization (Meera et al.
        2004).
      </p>
      <p>
        The analysis of education of the farmers shows that most
        (43.50%) of the farmers had studied high school and 27.50
        per cent of them had gone up to graduation and 13.00 per
        cent, 9.00 per cent and 5.50 per cent of the farmers had
        middle school education, higher secondary school
        education and primary school education, respectively. Two
        of them had studied up to post graduation and one had
        obtained a doctorate degree. Education is one of the
        important social factors that improve the attitude
        towards accessing agricultural information and their
        adaptation. The effect of education on adoption has been
        argued by several researchers. For instance, in separate
        studies, it was reported that education of the
        respondents was found to have significant relationship
        with their ability and interest to access agricultural
        information and its adoption (Ango et al. 2013; Rehman,
        2013; Ani et al. 2004; Okwu and Umoru, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
        The landholding size distribution shows that 62.00 per
        cent of the farmers belonged to the marginal and small
        categories while the remaining 38.00 per cent were medium
        and large farmers. Those farmers with land holdings less
        than five acres constituted the highest proportion of the
        farmers. This indicated that the farmers in India are
        generally small and marginal farmers (Surabhi and Gaurav,
        2009; Surabhi et al. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
        The years of individual farming experience show that
        54.00 per cent of the farmers had been involving in
        farming activities for 11 to 30 years, while 27.00 per
        cent had farm experience of more than 31 years . This
        clearly suggests that farmers have got enough experience
        in cultivating and managing their agricultural crops.

        Sources of Agricultural Information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Table 3 has been furnished with data on agricultural
        information sources used by the farmers and the data
        reveals that majority (93%) of the farmers relied mostly
        on agricultural extension officers for obtaining
        agricultural information followed by television/radio
        (75.50%), friends &amp; family (68.50%),
        newspaper/magazine (60%), farm supply vendors (55.50%),
        local farmer organizations (43.00%) and on their own
        experience (36%). With respect to getting information
        from agricultural extension officers, the result of the
        present study is contradictory to Singh et al. (2009) who
        found that extension officers were not regarded as a
        major source for getting information frequently. Several
        authors had reported that the most common source of
        information used by the farmers were progressive farmers
        followed by input dealers (Nitin, 2012; Ashutosh et al.
        2012; Surabhi et al. 2009; Glendenning et al. 2010).
        Progressive farmers still act as an important source of
        information in India.

        Adoption of agricultural information delivered to
        farmers' mobile phone
      </h3>
      <p>
        The main purpose of delivering information through mobile
        phone was to make farmers aware of the usefulness of
        modern crop management practices in enhancing a crop's
        productivity and subsequently to convince the farmers to
        adopt the technologies communicated. As indicated in
        Table 4, majority (54.00%) of the farmers did adopt the
        information disseminated through their mobile phone while
        4.00 per cent of the farmers had not yet adopted the
        information, but they were certainly intending to adopt
        the information obtained through mobile voice messages in
        future, once they had sufficient confidence in the
        messages received. However, 42.00 per cent of the farmers
        mentioned that they were not interested in using the
        information in the near future as the information was
        irrelevant to them. On the other hand, the reasons for
        successful adoption of the information by some of the
        farmers might be due to the fact that these farmers got
        the relevant agricultural information at the right time.
        Getting reliable, relevant information in time was
        important for farmers for farm decision making as
        reported by Glendenning et al. (2010).

        Usefulness of mobile voice messages
      </h3>
      <p>
        The mobile voice messages delivered to registered farmers
        contained agricultural information covering different
        aspects of fertilizer application, pesticide application,
        pest management, disease management, best agricultural
        practices, seed varieties, seed treatment, weeding and
        government schemes. The information was sent on a monthly
        basis and the message lasted for a maximum period of one
        minute. The messages had been relayed for about ten
        months with 10 - 15 messages being delivered on an
        average to each farmer. In order to understand the
        usefulness of voice messages, the farmers were asked how
        many messages they found useful in their daily farming
        practices. The findings are given in Table 5 and the
        results showed that 52.00 per cent of the farmers had
        expressed that either all or most of the agricultural
        information was useful, while 14.50 per cent of them
        expressed that information contained in half the number
        of messages was useful and 18.00 per cent of the farmers
        said that only few messages were useful. Only 15.50 per
        cent of the farmers indicated that none of the voice
        messages were useful to them. This might have been due to
        the information not being relayed to the farmers at the
        right stage of the crop or the information not being
        relevant to the crops they were growing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="article_subhead">
        Trustworthiness of mobile voice messages
      </h3>
      <p>
        With regard to trustworthiness of the voice messages, the
        data from Table 6 reveals that 92.50 per cent of the
        farmers felt the information received could be trusted,
        while only 7.50 per cent of them felt otherwise. Patel et
        al. (2010) who conducted a field study of Interactive
        Voice Forum among the small farmers in rural India
        reported that farmers preferred to obtain information
        from known and trusted experts rather than from other
        farmers. This confirmed that the information source is
        certainly important for farmers to take farm decisions.
        Similarly, Surabhi and Gaurav (2009) stated that although
        mobile phone can help in disseminating agricultural
        information to improve the farm productivity and rural
        incomes, trustworthiness of information is one of the
        important aspects that need to be considered while
        delivering to farmers to meet their needs and
        expectations.

        Farmers' satisfaction with mobile voice messages
      </h3>
      <p>
        With reference to satisfaction level of farmers, the data
        from Table 7 indicated that almost all the farmers (100%)
        were very satisfied with the audio quality, simplicity of
        language and content of the voice messages. It implied
        that the agricultural information that was disseminated
        through mobile voice messages could be easily
        comprehended by farmers. Agwu et al. (2008) had carried
        out a study on adoption of improved agricultural
        technologies disseminated through radio farmer programme
        in Nigeria and stated that the level of satisfaction of
        individual farmer will largely inhibit their utilization
        of this source of information. With respect to comparison
        of mobile voice messages with other sources of
        information, the data from Table 8 indicated that
        majority (62.50%) of the farmers did express that the
        mobile voice messages were better as compared to other
        sources of information that they were accessing.

        Relationship between socio economic characteristic of the
        farmers and their adoption of agricultural information
        disseminated through mobile voice messages (Table 9)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Farmer's decision on whether or not to adopt agricultural
        information relayed to them is an important variable that
        could determine the usefulness of the mobile voice
        messages. The socio economic characteristics like gender,
        age, education, land holding and farming experience may
        influence this decision either positively or negatively.
        The farmers were divided into three categories (farmers
        who have adopted the agricultural information, farmers
        who have not yet adopted but certainly intend to and
        farmers who do not intend to) for doing our analysis. The
        Chi square analysis was carried out on this data and the
        results show that all the socio economic characteristics
        of the farmers had no significant relationship with the
        adoption of information. There was no significant
        relationship between gender of the farmers and adoption
        of agricultural information disseminated through mobile
        voice messages. Similarly, age of the farmers had a
        non-significant relationship with adoption of
        agricultural information. This indicates that
        irrespective of age group (older or younger) and gender
        (male or female) farmers accept the agricultural
        information. Also education of the farmers had a
        non-significant relationship with the adoption of
        information. This could be, because, all the farmers were
        educated to some extent. Landholding size of the farmers
        had a non-significant relationship with the adoption of
        information. This implied that regardless of the land
        holding size the decision to adopt the agricultural
        information was uniform. Farming experience of the
        farmers also had a non-significant influence on adoption
        of the agricultural information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The non-significant relationships in the present study
        indicated that adoption of agricultural information was
        unlikely to be influenced by any of the socio economic
        characteristics of the farmers studied. The findings are
        in line with Ani et al. (2004) who reported that age and
        farming experience of rural women farmers in Nigeria were
        not found to have any significant relationship with
        adoption of farm technologies. However, education was
        found to have significant relationship with adoption of
        information. Mamudu et al. (2012) reported that farm
        size, age and education of the farmers significantly
        influenced the adoption of modern agricultural production
        technologies in Ghana. Similarly, Agwu et al. (2008)
        indicated that age and farming experience had significant
        influence on adoption of improved agricultural
        technologies disseminated through radio in Nigeria.

        CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
      </h3>
      <p>
        Based on the findings of the study, it could be concluded
        that mobile voice messages are an effective communication
        channel for disseminating agricultural production
        technology information to the farmers. The findings
        revealed that the majority of the farmers who listened to
        the agricultural information delivered through mobile
        voice messages were male and were within the active
        productive ages of 36 to 45 years. All the farmers were
        found to have received some form of education. It was
        also found that the majority of the farmers had adopted
        agricultural information received through mobile voice
        messages. It was observed that almost all the farmers
        were very satisfied with the mobile voice messages as
        they had effective audio quality and comprehendible
        content of agricultural information. Further, the
        language used to relay the information in the voice
        message was very simple and easy to understand by the
        farmers. Majority of the farmers were of the opinion that
        the agricultural information received on their mobiles
        was better than other sources of information they were
        accessing otherwise. Based on the Chi-square analysis, it
        was observed that the socio-economic characteristics of
        the farmers had no significant influence on the adoption
        of agricultural information disseminated through mobile
        voice messages. It indicates that irrespective of the
        socio-economic characteristics of the farmers, they were
        willing to accept agricultural information disseminated
        through mobile voice messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the basis of the findings in this study, it is
        recommended that there should be a further research on
        the impact of mobile based voice messages on agriculture
        being practiced across the delta region, particularly for
        small farmers. The information can be collected through
        focus group discussions and individual interviews with
        farmers at the village level. The objective of this study
        should be to seek answers to: Are the mobile based voice
        messages providing a more effective way of fulfilling
        farmers' information needs for timely, relevant and
        reliable information? Are farmers benefitting from yield
        improvements as a result of adopting recommended
        practices such as new varieties, best cultivation
        practices, pesticide applications, fertilizer
        applications, etc., received through these mobile voice
        messages? The answers to these questions will have
        important implications for the department of agriculture
        in state and central governments, agricultural
        information service providers and policy makers.
