  Corporate Farming in India:  
Is it Must for Agricultural Development? 
 Sukhpal Singh 
 1. Introduction
  
Agriculture in India still engages about 58% 
of the work force and contributes about a 
quarter of the GDP (Table 1). A very large ma
jority of the farmers/cultivators belongs to 
the category of small and marginal holders. The number and proportion of such holdings 
have been growing over time. They constituted 68.15% of the total operational holdings 

in 1971-72 but their proportion increased to 80.59% in 1991-92. The area cultivated by 
them has grown from 24.01% of the total in 1971-72 to 34.3% in 1991-92 (Singh, 2005). 
The share of marginal and small holdings in
creased to 61.6% and 18.7% respectively by 
1995/96, altogether accounting for 80.3% of all holdings (Table 2). Most of these farms 
are family farms characterized by use of
 household labour, production for consumption, 
stock, and sale in that order, highly diversif
ied to reduce risk, and weak market linkage, 
though improving with commercialisation. These farms have socio-cultural, economic 
and technical dimension in their management and are quite complex and dynamic 
institutions in themselves (Toulmin and Gueye, 2003). On the other hand, the number of 
farms in the largest category declined and the average size of the largest category was 
falling. Further, large holdings (>4 ha) were estimated to decline to only 7% by 2000-
2001 and 5% by 2010-2011 and account for only 36% and 28% of the area respectively 

(Jha, 2001). Given this general picture, it is not surprising that the average size of 
operational holding has been declining since the 1960s and was only 1.57 hectares and 
average size of ownership holding only 1.14
 hectares in 1992. Small farmers (with 
holdings of <2 ha) accounted for 83.9% of all operational holdings by 2003 (Singh, 2005) 
Also, small farmers (including landless) had higher livestock ownership (60-80% of all 

livestock population) including cross-bred 
cattle where 12-20% small farm and landless 
households owned these animals compared with only 8-15% in case of larger farm 
households (Jha, 2001). By 2002-03, the average size of operational holding has come 
down to 1.09 hectares and proportion of smal
l and marginal holdings in total operational 
holdings as high as 86%.

Small farms produce 41% of India™s total grai
n (49% of rice, 40% of wheat, 29% of 
coarse cereals and 27% of pulses), and over ha
lf of total fruits and vegetables despite 
being in rain fed areas, resource constrai
ned, and assuming that they are only as 
productive as large farms (Singh, et al, 2002; Muller and Patel, 2004). Their contribution 
to incremental wheat and rice production during 1971-1991 was even higher (62% and 
48% respectively). The marginal holdings also had higher cropping intensity (143) 

compared with that of the small, medium and large farmers (129.9, 119.6, and 111.6 
respectively) in the mid 1980s and higher irrigated area as percentage of net sown area 

with more of it being irrigated by tubewells and canals (1/3
rd each) and even that with 
tanks being quite important (8-11%) (Agrawal, 2000; Singh, et al, 2002).  
 
Dairying accounts for more than 50% of the household income of the landless and 30% of 
that of the marginal and small landholders. In fact, at the lower end of marginal and small 
farmer category are those who are ‚near landless™ i.e. they owned land between 0.002 and 
0.200 ha only and accounted for more than 31% of rural households in 1991-92. These 
are households besides the landless (owning <0.002 ha) who accounted for 11.3% of the 

total rural households.  The ‚near landless™ 
category has shown a steady increase since the 
late 1960s. Thus, more than 42% of the rural 
households were landless or near landless 
(Rao and Hanumappa, 1999).

 Since the new economic policy has already made
 significant progress in the trade and 
industrial sectors, the focus is now shifting towards bringing about structural reforms in 
other sectors especially agriculture in terms of mode of organisation of production. This is 

being attempted in order to bring in better efficiency of input and output markets and 
promote growth performance of the sector ultimately resulting in rural poverty reduction in 
India. Though India economy has grown at a 
high rate (6%) during the last decade, 
agricultural growth rates have lagged far behind
 (1-2%). Additionally, the agrarian distress 
and ecological crisis in the largely small farmer dominated agrarian economy has made 
matters worse in the presence of globalised 
and liberalised agricu
ltural markets. The 
agricultural reforms are being undertaken with primacy given to public-private partnership 

and a significant role being assigned to private corporate sector in rural development and 
poverty reduction through trickle down of growth. Corporate farming is one such initiative 
attempted in many Indian states alongside contract farming. Corporate farming refers to 
direct ownership or leasing in of farmland by business organisations in order to produce for 
their captive processing requirements or for th
e open market. When it is done for captive 
purposes, it is referred to as captive farming 
as well, though most of the time, the two terms 
are interchangeably used. Though, at present, corporate farming is not allowed in India, there 
have been loud voices in the recent years to
 get the legal constraint removed so that 
agribusiness firms could acquire 
and cultivate land for their raw material requirements. The 
most vocal demand has been that by the corporate businesses and business associations. 

Surprisingly, even Sharad Joshi argues for giving a golden handshake to marginal and small 
land owners and allowing farmer corporations
 to do corporate farming. Even Punjab State 
Farmers™ Commission (PSFC) has recently recommended pulling out of uneconomic 
landholders from farming by providing alternative livelihoods (PSFC, 2006). Since 
corporate farming is not legal at present, the agribusiness firms are increasingly choosing 
leasing in land option to resort to corporate fa
rming or contract farming as a way out of the 
situation. In contract farming, they work with independent growers or their groups under 

contracts for production and procurement of re
quired quality raw materials at pre-agreed 
price and volume or acreage. 
 This paper profiles the nature and extent of corporate farming in India in section 2 and 
examines its rationale in the Indian context in
 section 3. It then goes on to examine the 
    IIMA

validity of the various arguments advanced in favour of corporate farming in section 4.  It 
concludes in section 5 with some alternat
ives to the corporate farming model.   
2. Context and Nature of Corporate Farming in India 
Agriculture is a state subject in India so far as policy making is concerned. Therefore, many 
state (provincial) governments in India have attempted liberalisation of land laws, especially 
land ceiling laws (Table 3).  The states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and 

Maharashtra have recently allowed agribusiness 
firms to buy and operate large land holdings 
for R&D, and export-oriented production purposes. And, even states like Punjab are 
planning to raise the ceiling on holdings in order to encourage large-scale farming for 
making farming a viable proposition in the state.  The farmer organisations and political 
parties representing larger farmers in Punjab are also lobbying for the removal or relaxation 
of the Ceiling on Land Holdings Act in Punjab
 (Dhaliwal, 2005). Some of the corporate 
agencies in the state are asking for longer term lease (20-30 years) of farmers™ land for 
corporate farming. The states of Maharashtra 
and Gujarat have also enacted laws to allow 
corporate farming on government wastelands by providing large tracts of these lands (upto 
2000 acres each) to agribusiness companies on
 a long term (20 year) lease (Bharwada and 
Mahajan, 2006). The Chhattisgarh State Government is also making available about 20 lakh 

hectares of land for jatropha (biofuel) cultivatio
n. Under the scheme, an individual can lease 
up to 200 hectares of land at a price of Rs 100 per hectare, per year for the first five years. 
For subsequent years, these rates could be
 increased.  The State Government has already 
formulated an action plan including the setting up of the Chhattisgarh Bio-Fuel 
Development Authority, identifying Government
-owned waste or fallow land as well as 
constituting task forces in vari
ous districts (The Hindu Business Line, Sept. 2, 2005). Earlier, 
the government of Andhra Pradesh had attempted corporate farming under a project in 
Kuppam in Chittor district during 1997-2002 where the purpose was to test the feasibility of 
large scale farming through contract farmin
g on lands leased by agribusiness company 
(BHC Agro India Private Limited - an Israeli consultancy firm). The focus was on precision 
farming, drip irrigation and quality standards (Dash, 2004).  In fact, these changes in land 
laws can be viewed as a part of the global process of new internationalisation of agriculture 

wherein new production mechanisms (technology and other inputs) and the new actors 
(global capital and trading interests) are setting new rules of the game (Raynolds et al, 1993). 
It is basically a private sector led strategy of agricultural development being pursued as was

the case in Thailand during the 1980s and early 1990s with contract farming driving the 
model of agricultural development there (Singh, 2005).

th August, 2006.  Wastelands in India 
There were 21.22 million hectares of barren and uncultivable land (7% of total reported 
area), 11.8 million hectares of permanent past
ures and grazing land (3.9% of total reported 
area), 15 million hectares of culturable wast
e land (4.9% of total reported area) and 23 
million hectares of fallow land (7.7% of total 
reporting area) in India 
in 1990-91. Overtime, 
most of these categories of wasteland have dec
lined in area terms, ex
cept current fallows, at 
the All India level as well as across states. Gujarat and Rajasthan have large culturable 
wasteland as percentage of total reporting area (10% and 30% respectively) compared with 
all India average of 17%. They account for 4% and 18% of the total wasteland in India 

respectively (Table 5 and Maps 1 and 2). They also account for 15% and 16% respectively 
of total barren and unculturable land in I
ndia. There have been many initiatives of the 
NWDB, Department of Wasteland Development, MoAC, MoEF, and the Planning 
Commission for the development of wastelands, besides the Tree Growers™ Co-operatives 
(TGCs) of the NDDB (FES, n.d.).

.  But, the overall performance of these schemes 
has been slow and inadequate due to reasons 
like lack of finance, non-transfer of land 
to communities, poor design of public-private 
partnership schemes, and land ceiling laws at the state level (Chadha, 1996). The 
development of wastelands still remains a challenge, and there are issues of gender and 
equity in the development programmes (Chadha, 2002; FES, n.d.). Therefore, there is a 
renewed interest in handing over wastelands to
 private companies on a long term lease basis 
more recently as part of the overall liberalisati
on and privatisation process in the rural sector. 
The government of Gujarat has recently offered 
wastelands upto 2000 acres for horticulture 
and biofuels for 20 year lease to big corporate houses and resourceful farmers at the rate of 
Rs. 500 per acre interest free security deposit. If project does not take off in five years, the 
leased land will be taken back and the deposit 
forfeited. There will be no rent for the first 
five years. For the years 6-10, annual rent will be Rs. 40 per acre and for years 11-20, annual 
rent will be Rs.100 per acre. There will be a 50% increase in rent if any value addition 
activity is taken up on the land. The leasee will use micro irrigation technology which is 

being supported by the Gujarat Green Revolution Company with an initial capital of Rs. 
1500 crore. The mortgage of land for loan purposes is allowed. No ‚non-agricultural™ 
permission will be required for processing activity (Bharwada and Mahajan, 2006).

  Corporate Farming in India 

 
By now, there are many cases of corporate farming in India (Table 6) as land ceiling laws 
have been either manipulated by some corporates in the past or have been liberalised by 
some provincial governments as part of the new economic regime and in a bid to attract 
domestic corporate and foreign investment into agricultural sector.

mainly fruit trees 
It has 12 farms with four in Tamilnadu, seven in Maharashtra 
and one in Goa. A total of 1500 acres is made up by about 
650 acres in Tamilnadu, 750 acres in Maharashtra and 100 

acres in Goa. The land put to CIS was bought from farmers 
and was cultivable wasteland. Each farm is in a compact zone 
in each State and mostly in Konkan region. The land was 
bought at the rate of Rs. 25-30,000 per acre. CIS provided for  
80:20 sharing of profits from plantations, now through 

exports of fruits, with 80% going to the investors after 
meeting all expenses. There were about 800 participants in the 
CIS with the largest and the only one with 150 acres and the 

smallest with 0.5 acres which was the minimum needed as per 
the scheme. There is a formal agreement with share holders 
which is renewed every 5 years. The company is only 

managing the farms on behalf of the owners. Now, certified 
organic production for domestic and export markets is 
undertaken on these farms.

7500 acres of farm land which has mango occupying 450 
acres that  makes it the largest mango orchard in Asia. The 
farm was originally set up as an environmental protection 

measure near its refinery. Now, it is being seen as a profitable 
venture in itself. The company has invested Rs. 10 crore on 
the farm during the last 3-4 years and plans to have such 

farms in other states like A.
P., Maharashtra and Karnataka. 
The projects are expected to take seven years for breakeven 
and give 30% return after that. More recently, it has been 
alloted 625 acres of government owned panchayat and 

common land for its Rs. 5000 crore agribusiness project in the 
state of Punjab out of which 300 acres are prime agricultural 
land. Some of this land (150 acres) is on a 30-year long lease 

and the rest is bought by the company. It is undertaking 
export oriented corporate farming (50%).  Also planning to 
sell the farm produce in domestic market through Reliance 

Retail outlets.

equal partnership 

venture between 
Bharti Enterprises 
(Airtel group) and 

Rothschild 
Punjab; fresh 
fruits and 

vegetables  
It acquired 300 acres of land from the Government of Punjab 
for its model R&D farm called the ‚FieldFresh Agri Centre of 

Excellence™ near Ludhiana. The primary focus is on crop and 
varietal trials, progressive farming techniques, and 
identification and adoption of appropriate technologies. The 

farm includes 42 acres of state-of-the-art protected cultivation 
including poly-houses, glass and green houses, and net 
houses.  All FieldFresh farms are HACCP, EurepGap, BRC 

and AVA accredited. It has leased in 4000 acres and is using 
those former owner cultivators as labour on these leased farms.  
Distribution of fresh fruits and vegetables is done to the 

European Union, Eastern Europe, South East Asia, Middle 
East and the CIS countries. It has already sent the first 
consignment of vegetables to the UK included okra, bitter 
gourd and chilli. The project claims that the marginal leasee 

farmer livelihoods have improved compared to when they were 
cultivator owners as the project pays minimum wages (Rs. 
80/day). Thus, a farmer whose land is leased in by the company 
gets Rs. 15,000 per acre lease rent and if two of his family work 

on these leased out farms as labour, earn Rs. 57,600 annually. 
Thus, a two-acre farmer can earn Rs. about Rs. 90,000 (30000 
rent plus 60,000 wages) annually compared with what he gets 

from his farm (Rs. 50,000) as gross output (without any cost 
deductions) if he goes for wheat and paddy crop cycle which is 
very common in Punjab (personal communication with Mr. 

Rakesh Bharti Mittal). It is also working with other agribusiness 
firms like Rajtech Agro Plantations, Jaipur and Satluj Organics, 
New Delhi for leased land production of fruits and vegetables. 

Rajtech had last year leased 200 acres from 17 farmers near 
Chomu at the rate of Rs. 7000 per acre and was paying Rs. 5000 
per month to supervising farmers. The company gets 17% of the 

profits made by Fieldfresh on the sales of the supplies made.

on contract to landless and marginal farmers with each getting 
6-12 acres for 10 years.  They will also be provided water, 
electricity, and milch animals along with land. It will also have 

veterinary and milk chilling facilities. The milk produced on 
these farms will be procured by Vimal Dairy and after deducting 
all the payments due for water, electricity and animals, the 

farmers will be paid for their milk. The young calves of the 
animals will belong to farmers. The contract will be renewable 
with mutual understanding and the project is focused on women 

dairy farmers. It is expected 
to provide livelihoods to 70-100 
families. Domestic and export markets are the focus (as told 
by one of the company employees).

IEEFL corporate farming operations 
 
The farms have been leveled and provided with drip and lift irrigation implemented by 
Excel and Netafim. All these farms are now to
tally organic and certified by EcoCert since 
1997. The certification cost for all the farms is Rs. seven lakh per annum. The farms were 
bought in the name of the directors of the company as agriculturist who were so to begin 
with, and some employees of the company who were also agriculturists, to avoid the Land 

Ceilings Act. The other shareholders in 
the scheme to whom the land was to be 
transferred were made agriculturists by buying 100 acres of wasteland in M.P. as it was 
already permitted there. This land was bought by the company in the name of investors. 
The titles of the farms bought in Maharasht
ra were transferred to these so called 
agriculturists. In Tamilnadu and Goa, there is no condition of only agriculturists being 

eligible to purchase land. Though the share pr
ice varies across farms and farmers in 
Maharashtra, it was Rs. 1,30,000/- per acre per share of which Rs. 30,000/- was spent on 
land development and registration besides maintenance of the land. The gestation period 
has just got over and now the 80:20 shari
ng will take place. However the land 
appreciation has already taken place for the investors. The company also gives gifts of 
farm or any other organic produce to the investors.  
 Mainly horticultural crops are grown on I
EEFL farms besides some intercrops. The 
organic bananas were sold to the NDDB during 1998-2003 for processing into banana 
puree for export which were of the order of 
400 MT. These were advance orders with 
50% advance payment and a premium of 30% on market price for conventional bananas

in Jalgaon market in Maharashtra. Besides, a commission of Re. one per kg. was paid as 
transport cost for delivery to the NDDB factory at Goregaon in Mumbai. The NDDB 
factory was also certified organic as part of IE
EFL™s ‚chain of custody™ with the cost of 
certification being born by the NDDB. Other than selling to the NDDB, the organic 
produce was sold in the local market as the company was not involved in exports or 
domestic marketing of organic produce. Even
 now, there are no direct exports by the 
company. The supplies to NDDB have been stopped now due to crash of international 
prices for banana puree. The CIS still continues though no returns have been given to the 
investors so far. There is a farm manager 
for each farm and one assistant for 50 acres 
each. The labour supply comes from those who sold land to the company and work as 
casual labour. The manager and the assistant, besides a watchman, stay on the farm.  

 The farm managers of the company have been trained in organic farming by experts. The 
present supply chain manager is a former em
ployee of Excel Industries. Since its own 
farms were in wasteland, it got certification in first year itself. It also provides 
consultancy for organic farms at the rate 
of 15% of project cost except land and 
infrastructure or including them in some cases, so that it has larger base to procure from. 
It has provided such services to 12 farms in India already and one in Oman. So far as 
corporate farming is concerned, the cost of
 production is very high due to the high 
overheads. Here the company is continuing as its only managing the farms in the name of 
shareholders who are land owners (Singh, 2006).
                                                                                                                                 
                                                  
3. Rationale for Corporate Farming
  It is argued that large-scale corporate agricu
lture is more efficient than peasant farming 
prevalent in the country. It leads to better allocative efficiency, induces higher private 
investment in agriculture, and results in higher output, income and exports (Mishra, 1997). 
The average size of the operational marginal holdings was only 0.35 hectares and those of 
the small holdings 1.41 hectares in 1992 compared with 2.69 and 5.79 hectares 
respectively of the semi- medium and medium
 category holdings and 15.41 hectares in 
the case of large category holdings. The owne
rship holding averages for these categories 
were even smaller with the exception only of large category holdings which was slightly 
larger (Singh, 2005).  In fact, it has been argued that the small and marginal farms even in 
states like Punjab are not viable for sustaining a family and need larger holdings (Johl, 
1995). These small holders should get out of farming if they are not able to move on to more 
    IIMA

W.P.  No.  2006-11-06 
export-oriented and commercial crops like fruit 
and vegetables as it will not be viable to 
grow food crops on small holdings. Even some farmer leaders like Sharad Joshi of Shetkari 
Sanghatana argue that the state should facilitate the exit of small and marginal farmers from 
farming by buying their land at market prices and provide them capital and training to go for 

non-farm occupations. Only those who have the mindset, technology, management, and 
financial resources to face the challenge 
of the Second Green Revolution should be 
permitted to do farming as an agribusiness (Joshi, 2006). Further, small farms are highly 
fragmented. Land transactions have led to 
further fragmentation making them non-viable 
in terms of resource use as well as family sustenance. The costs of fragmentation included 
increased travel time between farms and hence lower labour productivity, higher 
transportation costs of inputs and outputs, negative externalities for land quality 

improvement like irrigation, loss of land on boun
daries and greater potential for disputes 
(Mani and Pandey, 1995).  A study of a Tamil Nadu village found that, of the small 
farmers (60% of all) who owned less than three hectares of land each, 35% had 3-5 plots 
and 25% had 5-10 plots and the remaining less than three plots. On the other hand, of all 
the farmers in the village, only 20% farmers had more than five plots each, another 40% 

had 3-5 plots each and remaining less than
 three plots each. Thus, small farms were 
somewhat more fragmented. Further, the st
udy showed that fragmentation had adverse 
impact on the technical efficiency and the production of most of the crops, and 

consolidation led to large gains in technical efficiency. But, still markets have not even 
led farmers to consolidate their operational holding, if not owned holdings (Parikh and 

Nagarajan, 2004). 
 Further, export-oriented agriculture requires large investments which only big agri-business 
enterprises can afford (Rangswamy, 1993). It is
 argued that India has been exporting some 
agricultural products which are available for ex
ports after meeting domestic requirements. It 
is alleged that she has never produced for export.  This not only leads to instability of 
supplies in domestic markets, but also a failu
re to meet export commitments, which results 
in losing the established markets.  Besides, India ends up going to the world market for 
importing for domestic consumption as well.  It is here, that corporate farming is a must for 

stable production and export performance (Singh, 1994).  It is also said that allowing foreign 
companies to buy and operate land would open the doors to their technology in horticulture, 
food processing, etc. Further, if there is no 
ceiling on the assets of a firm, why should there 
be such a restriction on the farm firms or agribusiness enterprises? (Johl, 1995).

 4. The Case Against and Evidence 
 The opponents of corporate farming argue that allowing companies to buy land will make 
farmers landless since the companies would offe
r prices which may be too tempting for the 
poor farmers to resist and they may not be able to negotiate fair prices for their land.  Land 
owners, therefore, would run the risk of becoming landless (Vyas, 2001).  Further, other 
stakeholders in such land other than the title 
holder, like women or children, may run a risk 
of losing access to such land and therefore food 
security and social status. This has serious 
gender implications in an already gender biased rural context. To avoid such a situation, it is 
proposed to allow only leasing in of land by the companies and to share the company profits 
with the farmers who will lease out land to the 
companies.  On both these fronts, the chances 
of agriculturists being taken for a ride by the companies are quite high.  The key issue is how 
to protect the farmers, while allowing the companies to use their land where the farmers 
work as labour and suffer from the monopolistic contracts with the companies? (Dash, 
2004).  Also, in a country where the population pressure on agricultural land is already high, 
it is debatable whether captive or corporate farming is the most optimal use of agricultural or 

even degraded land.  
 Also, investing capital in land purchase per se does not yield profit, irrespective of the 
existence or absence of ceilings on land owners
hip.  Such an investment by a business 
enterprise is solely for the purpose of rent
-seeking and/or for unearned speculative capital 
gain in a situation of fast rising land prices.  Corporate demand for removal of ceilings 
makes sense only in the presence of such a motivation.  But, this is contrary to the nature of 

a corporate, capitalist enterprise driven by profit 
seeking.  Such an invest
ment is also socially 
wasteful of capital, even otherwise a scarce social
 resource.  It merely le
ads to the transfer of 
land from one hand to another (Mishra, 1997).In fact, it is known from experiences of other 
developing countries, and of India where contract farming is now widespread, that 
agribusiness firms producing for export tend to undermine the local food production systems 
as they go in for export-oriented non-food crops by displacing area under basic food crops 
which is so crucial for local and national food security (Patnaik, 1996) and exploit farmers 

(Dash, 2004). 
 In the past too, many attempts to allow captive farming on degraded land under the agro-
forestry programmes have become controversial over such issues as the definition of 
    IIMA  
  INDIA
 Research and Publications

W.P.  No.  2006-11-06 
degraded land and the displacement of those holding grazing or other common rights to such 
land as the ‚so-called wasteland™
 is not really wasteland for those who depend on it for their 
livelihoods (food, fuel, and fodder needs) as a common property resource (Singh, 2002; 
FES, n.d.)) as is the case of Maldharis in Gujarat.
 Further, classification 
of wastelands is also 
questionable as e.g. in Gujarat ‚common lands™ and ‚uncultivable™ land have been classified 
as wastelands (Bharwada and Mahajan, 2006). 
 So far as efficiency is concerned, there is no conclusive evidence of farm productivity rising 
with increasing farm size, rather small farms have been found to have higher output per 
hectare (Toulmin and Gueye, 2003).  In fact, 
land reforms drew their logic from the evidence 
which pointed to the inverse relationship between farm size and productivity (Lipton, 1993). 

Also, economies of scale are important not at the production level but at the processing stage 
which can be availed of under contract farmin
g or co-operative processing arrangements 
(Vyas, 2001).  If the argument of efficiency of 
large holding has any logic at all, it can still 
be practised by increasing the size of operational holdings even under the existing land laws 
by way of consolidation. Ownership of la
nd is not a necessary condition for corporate 
agriculture.  Since agricultural sector in India, 
quite in contrast to th
e industrial sector, has 
functioned in a competitive environment - w
ith very large number of producers and 
consumers in the market - there is no evidence to suggest that under the present system of 

peasant farming, allocation of resources is in
efficient (Rao, 1995).  If a proof is needed, it 
should be seen in the growth rate of agricultural production and changes in the efficiency of 

capital use. Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3 Œ3.5% per annum 
since the late 1960s and the marginal efficiency
 of capital in Indian agriculture more than 
doubled, from 0.150 in the 1960s to 0.414 in the 1980s (Mishra, 1997). 
 Further, the experiment of corporate farming in many developed and developing country 

situations did not succeed largely due to the inte
rnal problems of the ag
ribusiness firms. For 
example, in Iran, most of the firms failed, 
when they were given large chunks of land for 
cultivation, due to the mismanagement which resulted from the lack of relevant experience. 
The main reasons were managerial in nature, like neglect of field improvement, no 
contingency planning, under-capitalisation, managerial inflexibility, and poor labour 
relations (Strohl, 1985; Johnson and Rutt
an, 1994)). The extern
al reasons included 
diseconomies of scale which suggested that there were limits to farm size growth worldwide 

(Johnson and Ruttan, 1994). Large-scale corporate farms failed in UK, Venzuela, Ghana, 
    IIMA  
  INDIA
 Research and Publications 
Page No. 21 
W.P.  No.  2006-11-06 
Brazil, and Philippines besides Iran despite the presence of significant ‚external economies 
of scale™ in terms of subsidis
ed inputs including land, low interest credit, and tax and duty 
benefits (Johnson and Ruttan, 1994; Toulmin and Gueye, 2003). A major adverse fall out of 
such schemes was displacement of large number of peasant farmers (Toulmin and Gueye, 

2003). On the other hand, there have been many cases of success when the firms worked 
with local farmers under the contract system or leased in their land (Johnson, 1985).  
 The argument of parity with the industrial sector for removal of ceilings (Johl, 1995) too 
does not stand ground on closer examination.  It
 is well known that the assets of a private, 
corporate industrial firm are not exclusively owned by those who control and manage it or 
by the business house in whose name the firm is run.  The assets are owned by hundreds, 

and in cases where the firm is large, by tens of thousands of shareholders, financial 
institutions, and trust funds. When such a patt
ern of asset ownership is transplanted to 
agriculture, it implies widespread ownership 
of land and also capital assets of an agri-
business firm.  This condition is met when hundreds of landowners in various size-classes 
lease out their land to the firm and become shareholders in its capital investment, if the firm's 

goal is direct agricultural production. Alternativel
y, if the firm's goal is agro-processing, then 
the above condition is met by vertical co-ordination of production, processing and 

marketing.  In this case, hundreds of owner-farmers engage in required type of production 

under a contractual arrangement, and the agro-processing enterprise processes the produce. 
However, under such an arrangem
ent, transaction costs of the enterprise are high and when 
the open market price of the produce is high, delivery of the produce becomes uncertain as 
the producers divert the produce to the open ma
rket. The solution to such problems lies in 
making the producers shareholders in the enterprise in such a way that they not only share 
the transaction costs but also lose on the dividend earnings for failure to deliver more than 
the expected gains from open market sales.  In brief, they are made to have a stake in the 

processing enterprise (Mishra, 1997). 
 5. Conclusion  
 
There is no case for removal of ceilings on la
nd holdings for corporate business to operate 
in agricultural production sector or for farmers to reap economies of scale, on grounds of 
size limitation, provided there exists a freer 
land-lease market (Vyas, 2001; Dogra, 2002). 
If operational holdings are to be enlarged for more viable operations, that can be achieved 

by making the land lease market more efficient or by pooling land together under some 
    IIMA

co-operative enterprises, for collectively bu
ying inputs and selling produce, if not for co-
operative farming. If agricultural growth is to be shared in order to realise the virtuous 
circle of growth and distribution, only a peasant farming system using modern technology 
of production can achieve it, as the East-Asian experience has shown.  Not only it is more 

competitive compared to the capitalist/corporate farming system, but also peasants do 
respond and adopt new technologies of production whenever opportunity arises.  The 
experience of the Green Revolution in Punjab is an excellent example of this.  Secondly, 
it is able to employ more labour as the peasant farmers substitute labour for capital much 
better, than the capitalist farming can ever do, given its normal motive to maximise profit 
(Mishra, 1997).    
There is, however, a case for increasing the 
holding size at the lower end to make the 
holdings viable (Mani and Pandey, 1995).  This 
can be done by provision of term credit 
through Land Development Banks to the small/marginal farmers below the poverty line, 
so that those willing could purchase land and increase the size of their ownership holdings 
(Rao, 1995).  But, it may not help solve the problem of viability as it leaves no room for 

those at the lowest end who want to move out of it. The best course seems to be to have a 
free land market within the limits of land ceilings, with provision of land purchase credit 

facility for the small/marginal farmers.  
But, given the population pressure, family 
divisions, equal inheritance law, and deep-rooted
 attachment to land, even this policy may 
not wholly succeed in eliminating the unviable marginal holdings.  About 15 years ago, a 

working group of agricultural economists under the chairmanship of late Sukhmoy 
Chakravarty, had come to the conclusion that introduction of a floor to the ownership 
holdings would be necessary to tackle the issue.  The U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land 
Reforms Act of 1950 accordingly has a clause fixing the floor limit at 1.26 hectare.  It is 
another matter that this provision has never been
 implemented.  Of course, it goes without 
saying that the floor limit will have to be di
fferent in different stat
es just as the ceiling 
limits are different (Mani and Pandey, 1995; Mishra, 1997).  
 Finally, there is a need to look at contract 
farming alternative as it meets the needs of both 
corporate agribusinesses as well as small pr
oducers. The superiority of contract farming 
over corporate farming is evident in its mo
re widespread and sustained practice as 
compared with corporate farming experiences 
(Winson, 1990) and in its positive impacts 
like producer link up with profitable markets, better farm incomes, skill upgradation due

to transfer of technology, and sharing of mark
et risk even in India (Glover and Kusterer, 
1990; Benziger, 1996; Dileep et al, 2002: Deshingkar et al, 2003; Dev and Rao, 2004). It 
does not atleast make small farmers landless unlike corporate farming. Even the 
environmental aspects of contracting are not as damaging as small farmers maintain 

control over farm operations which is good for environmental sustainability though when 
unregulated and not ethically
 practiced, it can lead to environmental degradation 
(Morvaridi, 1995; Singh, 2002) and exclusion of small producers (Warning et al, 2003; 
Singh, 2006a). Further, there is sharing of benefits in contracting as against corporate 
farming. Of course, this requires regulation and monitoring of contracting agencies by 
third parties or farmer organisations like co-operatives and farmer groups or the state. In 
general, contract farming has positive impact on non-contract growers and rural 

development in general if properly leveraged with state policy and local institutions like 
group contracts, though it is not a development tool (Goldsmith, 1985). It has been in 
practice in India for quite some time now with mixed results and more recently, there has 
been policy thrust on this mechanism of vertic
al co-ordination. Therefore, there is a need 
to build partnership into contract farmi
ng (Eaton and Shepherd, 2001) where companies 
not only offer contractual terms for working with farmers but also share their business 
risk and profits with producers as equity shareholders. It is being done successfully by a 

sugar company in Karnataka in south India.
