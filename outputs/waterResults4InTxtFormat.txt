  Abstract
 Efficient and sustainable utilization of resources
, particularly land and water resource
s for agriculture 
have
 occupied the centre stage in the economic ag
enda of a nation. The regional resource availability
 and the 
 biotic, abiotic and socio
-economic constraints 
are 
largely 
varied in the any crop production system of 
that
 region. The integration of sustainable resource use with the production 
programs 
and i
ncome as objective
s of farming 
thus
, 
leads to a multiple objective
-planning framework. 
Attaining sustainable 
increase in 
agriculture production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural 
resources base is 
therefo
re 
very important to 
achieve
 food security for 
the growing population
 in a 
developing country situation
. The current study is to develop appropriate 
land use pattern in crop agriculture
 for sustainable land and water use to the agricultural 
development in the 
Bavani Basin
 of 
western zone of 
Tamil Nadu
 state 
in southern India
, 
using 
a multiple goal 
linear programming approach.
 Bhavani basin in the 
western zone of Tamil Nadu
 - one of the most diversified in bio physical feature
s, was evaluated 
in this study.
 The 
land use model 
 employed in the study following 
 the bio
-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, 
(2003) 
who 
incorporated 
the 
important variations in the biophysical system (land and soils) and 
market characteristics. 
This study 
traced th
e alternative cropping pattern which 
would 
maximize
s the farm 
net income 
at a relatively lower water requirement, 
lower land requirement (
hectare days to ensure 
relatively more fallow period 
to lower land exhaustion rate) 
and that would lower the environme
nt damage 
in-terms of lower Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) 
with the given land and ground water availability of 
each identified ten homogen
eous land units
 beside the len
gth of growing period determined on the basis of 
quantum
 and distribution of rainf
all and temperature
.  The major biophysical factor
s considered 
beside
 the 
land availability, ground and surface water availability
 were;
 crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop 
sequence and climatic variations and these factors were specified a
s constrain
ts in the land use model. The 
input data for the model 
were collected from 
the 
sample respondents in the 
delineated homogen
eous land 
units. The actual water availability for each standard week (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective 

rainfall received during the period of crop stand from the total water requirement of each crop activity.  
 The land use model 
estimats 
reveal
ed the
 possibility of increasing the crop income fr
om 
the 
current level of 
INR
 6.14 billion to 
INR 
8.25 b
illion annually
. This alternative crop plan also helped to reduce the area under 
high water consuming crop
s in water deficit area
s.  3   INTRODUCTION
 Economic development and human welfare largely depend on optimum utilization of natural resources. 
There exist
s a wide spatial diversity in quantity and quality of land and water resources 
available 
and 
their 
efficiency in use for agricultural and non
-agricultural purposes. Efficiency and sustainability paradigms have 
therefore occupied the centre stage in the econ
omic agenda of a nation. A large proportion of India™s land 
shows clear evidence of advanced and continuous degradation, threatening to undermine the capacity to 

increase food production and alleviate rural poverty (Abrol, 1994). Despite the critical situa
tion, the increase 

in population led to decline the per capita availability of net sown area from 1.76 ha in 1950
-51 to 0.
11 ha
 in 
Tamil Nadu in India
 in 
2007
-200
8. On the other hand, the water availability for agriculture from both surface 
and ground wate
r sources 
was 
not able to meet the increasing demand by the changing cropping pattern and 
climatic variability. Annual internal renewable water resources in India fell by 652 cubic meter (cum)  per 

capita  in about 12 years i.e., from 1896 cum in 1988 to 1
244 cum in 2000 (HDR, 2000). The ground water 
estimation committee (1994) estimated the annual replenishable ground water potential to be 431 bcm and 

the ultimate irrigation potential in terms of area was estimated to be 80.38 mha. During the period from 
1984
-85 to 1998
-99, the number of dark
1 blocks (administrative unit consists of few villages) had increased 
from 253 to 428 at the national level. If this trend continues, the number of overexploited blocks would be 
doubled over a period of every twelve and
 half years (Swaminathan, 2002). In the State of Tamil Nadu the 
groundwater was over exploited in 54 bocks
 out of a total of 
385
-blocks
 which spread over in 16 districts 
(CWC, 2000). 
 
The integration of sustainable resource use with the production programs
 and income as objectives of 
farming thus, leads to a multiple objective
-planning framework. Attaining sustainable increase in agriculture 
production by considering the biophysical variability of the region without affecting the natural resources 

base is t
herefore very important to 
achieve
 food security for the growing population in a developing country 
situation. 
In 
such a 
situation
, there is an urgent need to identify concrete policy measures that would permit 
a simultaneous improvement of agricultural pr
oduction and conservation of natural resource base especially 

land and water resources. 
 Tamil Nadu 
state in 
southern 
India 
is divided into seven agro climatic zones based on rainfall distribution, 
irrigation pattern, soil characteristics, cropping pattern
, ecological and social characteristics. Among these 
seven zones, the Western zone consisting of Coimbatore and Erode districts 
covering Bhavani basin
 occupies 
12.03 per cent of the state
™s
 geographical area and 11.45 per cent of the state
™s
 net sown area.
 This zone 
accounts for 
close to 15 per cent of degraded land in the State. The western zone receives the lowest annual 

rainfall of 700 mm compared to the 959 mm for the State. Beside
s, well irrigation is 
the pre
domina
nt source 
of irrigation in this zone a
ccounting 
for 
about 53 per
 cent of total irrigated area. The depth of the water 
in 
this zone however, 
has fallen between 6 meters and 49.3 m
eters
 in the 
rainfall deficit years
 when the
 annual 
                                                 1 Dark block are were the groundwater extraction is more than recharge
 4  rainfall 
was 
around 450 mm. Due to poor maintenance and reductio
n 
in 
storage capacity of tanks, ponds and 
other small reservoirs 
also 
affect the groundwater recharge in th
is zone. The over extraction of groundwater 
and inefficient use of irrigation
 water
 for crops 
also 
leads to faster reduction in groundwater table. 
The current study therefore
 aims 
to answer the 
following 
question confronting the stakeholders in the region 
namely:
 1. What would be the optimal land allocation to different crop activities 
that will maximize the net 
farm income
 with the available 
land, 
water 
and environmental resources 
in 
the region?
  The overall objective of the study is to develop appropriate 
land use pattern in crop agriculture
 for 
sustainable land and water use to the agricultural development in the 
Bhavani basin of the 
west
ern zone of 
Tamil Nadu. 
 2. METHODOLOGY
 In India, private property right for land will leads to over exploitation of land, water other resources which 
causing spatial and temporal damages.  This study is indent to identify the land allocation pattern to th
e different crops and how the different resources or inputs like labour, water and credit are judiciously used to 

reach the maximum net return with the available production activities in the context of sustainability. In 
order to achieve the sustainability
 in land and water resources use, the spatial variability on bio
-physical 
characters must be considered. This would be achieved by 
identifying
 the homogeneous land which having 
same bio
-physical features of surface water availability, ground water status a
nd climatic feature like 
temperature, rainfall and Length of Growing period (LGP). 
 Land Use Model
 Land use studies dealing with the future prospects are generally of two types
 - predictive and explorative. 
The 
explorative land use studies focus more on de
fining the range of developmental possibilities at different 
scale (Van Ittersum 
et al
., 1998). These studies emphasized the biophysical possibilities, assuming that 
socioeconomic constraints could be managed in the long run (Van Keulen et al., 2000). Bio
-economic 
modeling (BEM) approach was used to analyze the combined effect of land degradation, population growth, 
market imperfections and increased risk of drought on household production, welfare and food security 
(Holden and Shiferaw, 2002). They used dy
namic non
-separable household model which maximized the 
household welfare. 
 The 
land use model
 employed in this study following 
the bio
-economic model by Shiferaw and Holden, 
(2003) 
which 
incorporated 
the 
important variations in the biophysical system (lan
d and soils) and market 
characteristics. 
Loborte et. al.(2009) dev
eloped and evaluated the methodology for exploring the lan
ds use 
option at s
ub national level to improve the scientific basis for lands use planning which 
provide
d the 
facilities 
for land ev
aluation for resource availability, scenario construction and land use optimization. 
Following the 
methodology t
his study
 would 
trace the alternative cropping pattern which maximizes the farm net income 
5  with the given land and ground water availability of
 each identified ten homogen
eous land units
 (HLUs)
.  The 
land and water availability of the each 
HLU
s were taken as constrain
ts. The actual crop water availability for 
each standard week (t) was estimated after adjusting the effective 
rainfall received during the period of crop 
stand from the total crop water requirement of each crop activity. 
 Input
-output coefficients
 The input
-output coefficients for the land use model were estimated from
 a sample
 of 
330 farm households  
spread in 22
 villages covering all identified 10 land units. 
The distribution of the sample households among 
the 10 
HLU
s is presented in Table 1.

 was
 developed 
which 
would 
maximize  net 
income from crop enterprise

crop 
activity was the major factor that would 
determine the selection of crops. Thus, the objective function was maximization of net income from cr

was assumed that only 60 per cent of total rainfall reaches soil profile and the remaining 40 per cent drained 
out through runoff and seepage. Then, the crop wise moisture availability through effective
 rainfall was 
estimated by adding these for respective weeks of crop stand in that location. The equation is as follows:

 Cropping Intensity (CI)
 was calculated as the perc
entage of gross cropped area (GCA) to the total cultivable 
land area available for cultivation (LA).
  *100GCA
CILA  Based on Subbian et al. (1999) Cumulative Land Utilization Index (CLUI) 
was calculated by summing the 
products of land area pl
anted to each crop and the actual duration of that crop in weeks and dividing this by 
the total cultivable land area times weeks.

would 
reach 
the 
maximum of 100 per cent when all 
the 
available land area was occupied by 
different
 crops throughout the year. 
Lesser CLUI with low level of water use that could generate maximum 
net income is preferred for 
land and water resources sustainability.
  Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
 is the ratio between the total net return realized from the irr
igated crop to total 
water used by the crop plan.

 Considering the complexity of the present static land use model for 10 different 
HLU
s, the General Algebraic 
Modeling System (GAMS 22.9, 2009) was used for developing the land use model. The model con
sist
ed of 
260 (10x26) crop activities with 520 (10x 26 x 2) equations each for land and water resources, 260 (10x24) 
equations for crop suitability constraints. Thus, totally 260 activities and 1040 constraints besides the non
-zero equations were used in f
ormulating the land use model and solved 
using
 GAMS. 
 3. Results and Discussion
 The results and discussions 
included
; the 
descri
ption
 the land area availability, delineation of the 
homogenous land units
, followed by the model results
.   The 
Bhavani 
basin of 
western zone of Tamil Nadu was divided into 10 agro
-ecological 
HLU
s by overlaying the 
three spatial attributes 
namely;
 (i)
availability of surface irrigation, (command area map)
; (ii)
 ground water 
categorization based on the ext
raction 
levels of ground water; 
and 
(iii) 
the climatic feature (by developing 
the length of growing period 
- LGP) using GIS overlay technique and the same is presented in the map (Figure 
1). 
 3.1 
General 
Characteristics
 of the sample farms
 identified 
in th
e HLUs 
 The farm and famer™s 
general 
characters such as
; farm size, family size, main and secondary occupation, 
family labour availability for farm operation were analyzed fr
om the sample data collected for each 
of the 
HLUs.
 The average farm size was 0.72, 1.64 and 4.95 ha for marginal, small and medium to large size farm 
categories, respectively. The marginal and small farmers constituted about 59 per cent of the total number
 of 
sample operational holdings in the 
Bhvani basin of 
western zone 
in Tamil Nadu 
and they operated only 15 
per cent of the cultivable area. The average family size in different farm size groups ranged from 4.00 

(marginal farms) to 4.68 members per family 
(in large farms) in which children constituted 15.19 per cent of 

the family size. Male members engaged in agricultural operations constituted 73 per cent, whereas, two 
thirds of the females were engaged in the agricultural operations. 
 11  3.2 Operational Expe
nditure for Major Crops 
under Homogenous Land Units 
 The operational expenditure for cultivating major crops in the western zone was estimated from the sample 
farms 
(Table 3) 
to derive the net income per hectare realized from each crop in each 
of the HLUs
. The 
operational expenditure includes all the paid out cost on inputs except the fixed cost
. The results indicated 
that the operational cost was the highest for sugarcane (
INR
 59484 per ha.) followed by 
INR
 58385, 
INR
 51864, 
INR
 43893 and 
INR
 28528 per ha for banana, turmeric, tapioca and groundnut, respectively. The 
cultivation expenses of kharif paddy was 
INR
 19027 while for rabi paddy it was 
INR
17840 per ha. Among 
different homogenous land units, farmers incurred marginally higher operatio
nal expenses in ayacut land 
units
 (irrigated) 
such as; 1CA, 1OA, 1RA, 1SA and ICG for most of the crops; this may be due to higher use of 
inputs to achieve the targeted yield with the limited resources

   12  3.3 Productivity of
 major Crops u
nder Homogenous Land Units 
 The productivity of major crops was estimated and the results would reveal that the average productivity of 
kharif paddy, rabi paddy, ragi and maize was 
52, 40, 30 and 29 qt
l/ha,
 respectively. The district average
 yield 
of these crops were 
33.11,
 29.06, 23.8 and 11.25 qtl per 
ha 
in Coimbatore district and 39.6, 41.65, 23.8 and 
22.8 qtl per ha f
or Erode district, respectively. The average yield of sugarcane (as main crop) was 108
0 qtl
/ha. 
While, the district average
 productivity of sugarcane was 87
0 and 102
0 qtl
/ha in Coimbatore and Erode 
districts
, respectively
. The variation in crop productivity among the land units was however less as revealed 
from the coefficient of variation with exception of 37 per cent of CV f
or rainfed maize
. 3.4 Net Income of Major Crops in Different Homogenous Land Unit Categories 
 The net income over the operational cost was estimated for the major crops in each 
of the HLUs 
and the 

result showed that turmeric recorded the maximum net income
 of 
INR 
71848 per ha over operational cost, 
followed by banana (
INR
. 70827) and sugarcane (
INR
. 46767). The low water consuming crops 
yielded net 
returns 
as follows
; cotton (
INR
. 13265), groundnut (
INR
. 44181), maize (
INR
. 10021) and onion (
INR
. 55762). 
In the ayacut land units (1CA, 1OA, 1RA, 1SA and ICG), the net return realized were comparatively higher at 
INR
 16679 vs 11296 for kharif paddy, 
INR
 8842 vs 
INR
. 6899 for rabi paddy, 
INR
 48433 vs 39928 for 
groundnut, 79050  vs 66086 for turmeric and 
INR
. 581
23 vs 35411 for sugarcane. The net income realized in 
each crop activity 
was considered in the land use model.
 3.5 Current Cropping Pattern in Different 
HLUs
  The alternative crop sets were optimize using the static land use model by using linear programmi
ng 
(LP) approach for each homogeneous land units with given land and water resource availability. In the land 

availability constraints 1.92 
lakh
 ha was excluded which covers area under Tamarind, Guava, Mango, 
Coconut, Tea and Coffee. Similarly, the net gro
und water availability was estimated with the average pump 
output, well output in liter per second in each homogeneous land units for 52 standard weeks. 
The current 

cropping pattern revealed,
 after excluding area under perennial crops
/trees
, 17 major crops
 were cultivated 
in different 
HLUs
 of about 4.45 lakh ha in 2004
-05. In order to understand the current status of the present 
cropping pattern, various efficiency indicators such as cropping intensity, cumulative land utilization index, 
share of the high a
nd low water consuming crops, commercial crops, rainfed crops and area under vegetable
 crops
 were 
aggregated 
for each 
HLU
 and the results are presented in Table 
4. The analysis presented in 
Table 
4 would show that
 paddy was cultivated 
in 
little
 over 
58,000
 ha followed by 
maize and sugarcane 
with
 30281
 ha
 and 25831 ha, respectively under irrigated condition. Groundnut, 
sorghum, pulses and fodder sorghum were the major rainfed crops 
that 
constituted 43
-57 per cent of 
cropped area. Groundnut cover
ed 47530 ha, 
next to sorghum
 with 91500 ha
. The fodder sorghum occupied 
52300 
ha. The cropping intensity was relatively high in 1OA, 1CA followed by 1CG under ayacut land units 
(133, 120 and 119 per cent
, respectively) 
whereas;
 it was 123, 128 and 105 under Non
-Ayacut (0RG, 0CA, 
0RA) land units. However cumulative land utilization index was relatively less in irrigated land units 
at 
38 per 
13  cent compared to 46 per cent in Non
-ayacut units. It 
would also be surprising
 to note that the area under 
high water consumi
ng crop
s (paddy, banana, turmeric
, tobacco 
and sugarcane) constituted almost 65 per 
cent of the area in non
-ayacut land units but it was around 31 per cent in ayacut land units. This need
ed 
 to 
be 
watched 
in terms
 of changes 
in the alternative crop set
 as we aim at a sustainable cropping pattern in this 
analysis
. Rainfed crops normally dominated in non ayacut land units.

 The 
analysis of
 HLU
 wise cropping pattern clearly 
revealed the fact 
that the current cropping pattern is 
ground water exploit
ative in
 nature
, particularly 
in ground water deficit 
HLUs 
(0CA, 0OA, 1CA,1CG, 1OA)
, 
more specifically in the non
-ayacut areas where the high water consuming crops dominated and alternately 
in the ayacut areas
 with higher cropping intensity ranging f
rom 110 to 133 per cent
. This warrant
s optimizing 
the current cro
pping plan for simultaneous increase in net income 
while reducing
 the pressure on ground 
water use.

       16  It could
 also
 be 
seen that
 the 
area under 
rabi season paddy 
decreased by about 62 per cent 
while 
a 83 per 
cent increase 
was noticed 
in kharif season paddy over current plan but
 overall
, the 
total 
paddy area has 
reduced from 0.58 
lakh
 ha to 0.42  
lakh 
ha. 
The paddy area rather evened out between the kharif and rabi 
seasons. The decline was more pronounced in the non
-ayacut HLUs, particularly in the greater ground water 
deficit ones. 
Among the other HWC crops, area
 under sugarcane and banana declined by 6
1.00 and 
16.97
 per 
cent respectively, while that of turmeric increased marginally by 
8.09
 per cent
 which 
may be due to higher 
net benefits
. Among the low 
water consuming crops, there was a marginal reduction in area under maize by 
9.50
 per cent, 
whereas
 area under crops like, groundnut, gingelly, cotton
 and tapioca increased considerably 
ranging from
 35.93 per cent to 154.60 per cent. In the case of ragi, tobacco, onion, sunflower
 and vegetables 
namely, 
brinjal, chilies and tomato, the increase was substan
tial ranging from 409.40 to 2369.14 per cent.
 Under rain fed conditions
, area under groundnut, 
grain sorghum, fodder sorghum,
 and pulses declined in the 
range of 12.96 to 76.05 per cent, whereas, area under gingelly, cotton and maize increased between 96.5
7 and 110.96 per cent. 
The inference is shift from high water consuming and rain fed crops to low water 
consuming and commercial crops including vegetables. 
A comparison of table 3 and table 4 would also show 
that the cropping intensity declined in the cri
tical, semi critical and over exploited HLUs
, whereas it increased 
in the safe HLUs. The CLUI also shown a decline in the critical and over exploited HLUs in terms of ground 
water, while overall it showed a marginal increase. All these are sign of a crop s
et that will sustain resource 
base and simultaneously help to increase the farm income substantially. 
 4 Conclusion and policy implication 
 The static land use model was developed with an intension to identify an alternative cropping plan which 

would take 
care of the land and water resource use sustainability besides maximizing net income from crop 

enterprise in 
the 
Bavani basin of the 
western zone of Tamil Nadu
 in southern India
. The land use model use
d the spatial variation in biophysical and socio
-economic variables of a region by incorporating spatial 
attributes of land and water resources. The major biophysical factor considered are the land availability, 
ground and surface water availability, crop suitability for the particular soil type, crop se
quence and climatic 
variations 
in terms of the length of growing period, 
and these factors were specified as the constrain
ts in the 
land use model. The input data for the model 
were collected from 
the delineated 
HLUs
. The 
optimum 
land 
use model reveals tha
t there is possibility of increasing the crop income 
in the upper Bhavani basin of 
western zone of Tamil Nadu 
form current level of 
INR
 6.14 billion to 
INR
 8.25 b
illion
. This alternative crop 
plan also helped to reduce the area under high water consumi
ng crop
s in water deficit area 
without
 affecting 
the land and water resources base.
 Thus
, it could be revealed from the land and water resource efficiency 
indicator
s for the alternative crop plan
, 
resulted
 sustai
nable resource use with higher net income
, 
achie
ved 
through
 the static bio
-economic model.
