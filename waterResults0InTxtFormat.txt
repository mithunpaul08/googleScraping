# Tamil Nadu Agricultural University releases pest and disease forecast

Adarsh Jain

The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University on Monday released a forecast to help
farmers to adopt preventive measures to save crops and prevent loss in yield.

| TNN | Oct 12, 2015, 09.43 PM IST

COIMBATORE: With frequent showers in the last two weeks, the risk of pest
attacks and diseases in agricultural crops has increased. The Tamil Nadu
Agricultural University on Monday released a forecast to help farmers to adopt
preventive measures to save crops and prevent loss in yield.  
  
The Centre for Plant Protection Studies, department of entomology and
department of plant pathology have together released a pest and disease
forecast for seven agricultural crops- paddy, cotton, tomato, turmeric,
sugarcane, groundnut and maize.  
  
Paddy: TNAU scientists have identified leaf folder and stem borer diseases in
the crops in Tirunelveli, Salem, Kanyakumari, Theni, Thiruvarur, Villupuram,
Dharmapuri, Madurai, Thanjavur and Pudukottai. To save the crops from further
attack, farmers are advised to spray neem seed kernel extract 5% along with
sticking agent 1 ml/lit. Farmers can also set up light traps (one/acre) to
monitor the pest population. If needed, farmers can spray one of the following
insecticides: Phosphamidon 40SL 225 ml/acre or Profenofos 50EC 400 ml/acre.  
  
The experts have also predicted the possibility of an outbreak of paddy blast.
Hence, the farmers are advised to spray hexaconazole (0.25%) twice a week.
Besides, foliar application of 0.2% Pseudomonas fluorescens at fortnightly
interval is recommended to increase the yield.  
  
Cotton: The centres of TNAU in Dharmapuri and Madurai districts have
identified sucking pests in the crop. The experts suggest the farmers to setup
yellow sticky traps (5/acre) to monitor the pest population. On the other
hand, to manage cotton bollworms, farmers can set up pheromone trap (5/acre)
depending on the type of bollworm. If needed, they can spray indoxacarb 14.5
SC 200 ml/acre or triazophos 40 EC 800 ml/acre.  
  
Tomato: It was noticed that the crops in Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur and
Dindugul districts were affected with tomato leaf blight. To avoid further
attack, TNAU scientists suggest to spray mancozeb (dissolve 2g in 1l water)
twice a week.  
  
Turmeric: Erode is a trade hub for turmeric, and crops in Erode, Coimbatore
and Tiruppur districts have been identified with turmeric leaf spot by the
TNAU scientists. To avoid loss in yield, which will in turn affect the market
prices, experts advised farmers to spray mancozeb (dissolve 2g in 1l water) or
propiconazole 0.2% twice a week.  

  
Sugarcane: In Salem, Sivaganga, Theni, Thiruvannamalai, Pudukottai and
Villupuram, borer pest complex were found below the economic threshold level.
However, TNAU scientists advise farmers to release the egg parasitoid
Trichogramma 2.5cc/ha to avoid further attack.

  

  
Groundnut: The crop grown in Erode, Salem, Sivagangai, Thiruvannamalai,
Villupuram, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram has been found affected with leaf
miner. If the rainfall levels are not normal, scientists predict that the pest
may exceed the economic threshold level, thus affecting the yield. To avoid
consequences, farmers have been advised to spray neem seed kernel extract 5%
along with sticking agent 1ml/l.

  

  
Besides leaf miner, scientists have also spotted dry root rot in few crops.
Farmers can spray 0.1% carbendazim in the soil, scientists say.

  

  
Maize: It has been found that crops in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Madurai,
Pudukottai and Dharmapuri have been affected with stem borer. Farmers are
advised to monitor the adult moths by setting up light traps and, if needed,
spray neem seed kernel extract 5% along with sticking agent 1ml/l.
