#  Need info on water availability to buy land for agriculture in Tamil Nadu

Posted By : Anonymous (not verified)

Posted Date : Thu, 2013-01-31 18:06

Hello,

We are a group of friends from Chennai interested in buying land to practice
agriculture seriously over a period of next few years.

We are totally new to this field but want to pursue it just because we love
it. Kindly let us know, which are the areas in Tamilnadu that we can look upon
for buying lands and which are good for cultivation and at the same time has
got definite level of water table.

Any information/guidance in this regard will be of much help to us.

Thanks in advance.
