<HR><P><H2><A NAME="b1-Introduction%20and%20overview"></A> Introduction and
overview</H2><P>An interesting observation arising from the preparation of
this year's special chapter on water and agriculture is how difficult it is to
generalize about water. Almost any statement requires qualification. For
example, while we can say that water is one of the most abundant resources on
earth, we know that less than 1 percent of the total supply is reliably
available for human consumption. Water is a liquid for the most part, but it can
also be a solid and a vapour. Drinking-water is certainly essential for human
survival but water-related illnesses are the most common health threat in the
developing world. An estimated 25 000 people die every day as a result of
water-related sicknesses.<SUP>1</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>1</SUP> UNEP. 1991. <I>Freshwater
pollution.</I> UNEP/ GEMS Environmental Library. No. 6.
Nairobi.</BLOCKQUOTE>One statement, however, needs no qualification: human
existence depends on water. The geosphere, the atmosphere and the biosphere are
all linked to water. Water interacts with solar energy to determine climate and
it transforms and transports the physical and chemical substances necessary for
all life on earth.<P>In recent years, water issues have been the focus of
increasing international concern and debate. From 26 to 31 January 1992, the UN
system sponsored the International Conference on Water and the Environment
(ICWE) in Dublin, Ireland. The ICWE called for innovative approaches to the
assessment, development and management of freshwater resources. In addition, the
ICWE provided policy guidance for the United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. UNCED highlighted the
need for water sector reforms throughout the world.<P>In 1993, the World Bank issued a comprehensive policy paper
defining its new objectives for the water sector. FAO recently established an
International Action Programme on Water and Sustainable Agricultural Development
(IAP-WASAD). Likewise, the UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, WMO, Unesco and UNEP are all
coordinating or participating in special programmes related to water
resources.<P>Other international, national and local organizations are
becoming more active in water issues. The 1990 Montreal meeting, "NGOs Working
Together", focused attention on drinking-water supply and sanitation. The
Canadian International Development Agency, the French Ministry of Cooperation
and Development, the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the United
Kingdom's Overseas Development Administration and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) have recently developed water resource
strategies for foreign assistance.<P>The message highlighted by all these efforts is that water is
an increasingly scarce and valuable resource. Of principal concern is our
failure to recognize and accept that there is a finite supply of water. The
consensus is that the growing water scarcity and misuse of freshwater pose
serious threats to sustainable development.<P>Competition among agriculture, industry and cities for limited
water supplies is already constraining development efforts in many countries. As
populations expand and economies grow, the competition for limited supplies will
intensify and so will conflicts among water users.<P>Despite water shortages, misuse of water is widespread. Small
communities and large cities, farmers and industries, developing countries and
industrialized economies are all mismanaging water resources. Surface water
quality is deteriorating in key basins from urban and industrial
wastes.<P>Groundwater is polluted from surface sources and irreversibly
damaged by the intrusion of salt water. Overexploited aquifers are losing their
capacity to hold water and lands are subsiding. Cities are unable to provide
adequate drinking-water and sanitation facilities. Waterlogging and salinization
are diminishing the productivity of irrigated lands. Decreasing water flows are
reducing hydroelectric power generation, pollution assimilation and fish and
wildlife habitats.<P>At first glance, most of these water problems do not appear to
be directly related to the agricultural sector. Yet, by far the largest demand
for the world's water comes from agriculture. More than two-thirds of the water
withdrawn from the earth's rivers, lakes and aquifers is used for irrigation. As
competition, conflicts, shortages, waste, overuse and degradation of water
resources grow, policy-makers look increasingly to agriculture as the system's
safety valve.<P>Agriculture is not only the world's largest water user in
terms of volume, it is also a relatively low-value, low-efficiency and highly
subsidized water user. These facts are forcing governments and donors to rethink
the economic, social and environmental implications of large publicly funded and
operated irrigation projects. In the past, domestic spending for irrigation
dominated agricultural budgets in countries throughout the world. For instance,
since 1940, 80 percent of Mexico's public expenditures in agriculture have been
for irrigation projects. In China, Indonesia and Pakistan, irrigation has
absorbed more than half of agricultural investment. In India, about 30 percent
of all public investment has gone into irrigation.<SUP>2</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>2</SUP> R. Bhatia and M. Falkenmark. 1992.
<I>Water resource policies and the urban poor:</I> <I>innovative approaches and
policy imperatives. </I>Background paper for the ICWE, Dublin,
Ireland.</BLOCKQUOTE>A significant portion of international development assistance
has also been used to establish irrigation systems. Irrigation received nearly
30 percent of World Bank agricultural lending during the 1980s. Spending
commitments for irrigation by all aid agencies exceeded $2 billion per year in
the past decade.<P>Once established, irrigation projects become some of the most
heavily subsidized economic activities in the world. In the mid-1980s,
Repetto<SUP>3 </SUP>estimated that average subsidies to irrigation in six Asian
countries covered 90 percent of the total operating and maintenance costs.
Case-studies indicate that irrigation fees are, on average, less than 8 percent
of the value of benefits derived from irrigation.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>3</SUP> R. Repetto. 1986. <I>Skimming the

Research Report No. 4. Washington, DC, WRI.</BLOCKQUOTE>Despite these huge investments and subsidies, irrigation
performance indicators are falling short of expectations for yield increases,
area irrigated and technical efficiency in water use. As much as 60 percent of
the water diverted or pumped for irrigation is wasted.<SUP>4</SUP> Although some
losses are inevitable, in too many cases this excess water seeps back into the
ground, causing waterlogging and salinity. As much as one-quarter of all
irrigated land in developing countries suffers from varying degrees of
salinization.<SUP>5</SUP> Moreover, stagnant water and poor irrigation drainage
escalate the incidence of water-related diseases, resulting in human suffering
and increased health costs.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>4</SUP> FAO. 1990. <I>An International Action
Programme on Water and Sustainable Agricultural Development.</I> Rome.<P><SUP>5</SUP> Ibid.</BLOCKQUOTE>Today, agriculture is often unable to compete economically for
scarce water. Cities and industries can afford to pay more for water and earn a
higher economic rate of return from a unit of water than does agriculture. (For
economists, water flows uphill to money.) For the first time in many countries,
agriculture is being obliged to give up water for higher-value uses in cities
and industries. Irrigators in some areas are now asked to pay for the water they
receive, including the full cost of water delivery. In other areas, new
regulations require farmers to pay for polluting streams, lakes and
aquifers.<P>The irony is that irrigated agriculture is expected to produce
much more in the future while using less water than it uses today. At present,
2.4 billion people depend on irrigated agriculture for jobs, food and income
(some 55 percent of all wheat and rice output is irrigated). Over the next 30
years, an estimated 80 percent of the additional food supplies required to feed
the world will depend on irrigation.<SUP>6</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>6</SUP> International Irrigation Management
Institute. 1992. <I>Developing environmentally sound and lasting improvements in
irrigation management: the role of international research. </I>Colombo, Sri
Lanka, IIMI.</BLOCKQUOTE>These developments are placing enormous pressure on
agricultural policy-makers and farmers. Throughout the world, governments assume
the prime responsibility for ensuring food security and, because food depends
increasingly on irrigation, food security is closely linked with water security.
Between 30 and 40 percent of the world's food comes from the irrigated 16
percent of the total cultivated land; around one-fifth of the total value of
fish production comes from freshwater aquaculture; and current global livestock
drinking-water requirements are 60 billion litres per day (forecasts estimate an
increase of 0.4 billion litres per year). Food security in the next century will
be closely allied to success in irrigation.<P>Irrigation can help make yield-increasing innovations a more
attractive investment proposition but it does not guarantee crop yield
increases. The overall performance of many irrigation projects has been
disappointing because of poor scheme conception, inadequate construction and
implementation or ineffective management. The mediocre performance of the
irrigation sector is also contributing to many socio-economic and environmental
problems, but these problems are neither inherent in the technology nor
inevitable, as is sometimes argued.<P>Irrigation projects can contribute greatly to increased
incomes and agricultural production compared with rain-fed agriculture. In
addition, irrigation is more reliable and allows for a wider and more
diversified choice of cropping patterns as well as the production of
higher-value crops. Irrigation's contribution to food security in China, Egypt,
India, Morocco and Pakistan is widely recognized. For example, in India, 55
percent of agricultural output is from irrigated land. Moreover, average farm
incomes have increased from 80 to 100 percent as a result of irrigation, while
yields have doubled compared with those achieved under the former rain-fed
conditions; incremental labour days used per hectare have increased by 50 to 100
percent. In Mexico, half the value of agriculture production and two-thirds of
the value of agricultural exports is from the one-third of arable land that is
irrigated.<P>Irrigation is a key component of the technical package needed
to achieve productivity gains. In the future, as high levels of costly inputs
are added to cropland to sustain yield increases, the security and efficiency of
irrigated production will become even more important to world farming. Water
will no longer be plentiful and cheap. It will be scarce, expensive to develop
and maintain and valuable in use. The prospect of high-cost water may at first
seem to be another problem looming for low-income economies. However, the high
cost will be an incentive to use water more efficiently. The single most
important factor limiting the adoption of proven irrigation and drainage
technology is the low cost of water. Moreover, if farmers have opportunities for
higher-value uses and can make profits, both governments and farmers will invest
in irrigation.<P>This water dilemma - to produce more in a sustainable way with
less water - points to the need for demand management mechanisms to reallocate
existing supplies, encourage more efficient use and promote more equitable
access. Policy-makers need to establish a structure of incentives, regulations,
permits, restrictions and penalties that will help guide, influence and
coordinate how people use water while encouraging innovations in water-saving
technologies.<P>In the past, supply-side approaches dominated water resource
management practices. Water itself was physically managed through technical and
engineering means that captured, stored, delivered and treated water. However,
the era of meeting growing demand by developing new supplies is ending. In our
present-day water economy, resource management is shifting away from the goal of
capturing more water towards that of designing demand- and user-focused
approaches that influence behaviour.<P><H2><A NAME="b2-Purpose%20and%20scope"></A> Purpose and scope</H2><P>This special chapter is primarily intended for agricultural
policy-makers, water managers, researchers, students, development planners and
agricultural project donors. It is meant to help us reflect on the way water
resources are managed at present; to contribute to the discussion on sustainable
water use; and to stimulate thinking, research and change. Decisions made in
this decade regarding how water is used will have a profound effect on our
future supplies.<P>This first section gives an overview of world water resources
and briefly discusses the key issues: scarcity, quality and health.<P>The second section stresses the need to integrate the water
sector with the national economy and analyses the physical, economic and social
aspects of water. It then provides a conceptual foundation for understanding the
circumstances under which water policies either work or fail. Section II also
assesses the advantages and disadvantages of broad alternative approaches to
public water policy.<P>Section III examines how policy analysis is applied to water
resource planning, including both supply-side (physical and hydrological) and
demand-side considerations. It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of
various policy options for urgent water policy issues related to surface water
and groundwater.<P>The fourth and final section reviews three specific policy
issues in irrigated agriculture: declining growth and investment trends; the
difficulties imposed by irrigation-induced environmental degradation; and
efforts to reform managerial and administrative systems.<P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><P align="center"><IMG SRC="t0800e14.jpg"><P><TABLE BORDER>

<P><I>BOX 8</I><P><B>THE HYDROLOGICAL</B> <B>CYCLE</B><P>Water continuously circulates on the planet. The hydrological
cycle has no beginning or end but we can describe it as starting with the waters
of the oceans, which cover about three-quarters of the earth. Radiation from the
sun and wind energy, which is itself indirectly derived from solar energy, cause
evaporation of water which rises as a vapour and forms clouds. In turn, if
conditions are right, these condense and fall back to earth as rain, hail or
snow.<P>Some of this precipitation evaporates from leaves and soil,
some runs over the surface and forms streams and some percolates into the soil
where it may be drawn on by plants and transpired back into the atmosphere or
returned to the surface by soil capillarity. Some soil moisture evaporates and
some soaks down below the root zone to join the groundwater reservoir.
Groundwater percolates through pores in the soil and rocks and may reappear on
the surface at lower elevations as a spring or as seepage into streams and
rivers which eventually re-enter the ocean. Still some lies in the groundwater
reservoir or aquifer and may be tapped by a mechanical tube well or an open
well.<P>The hydrological cycle illustrated in the Figure is the system
by which water circulates from the oceans through the atmosphere and back to the
ocean overland and underground. Available freshwater is a rare form of water,
for 99 percent is either saline (97 percent of all water is in the ocean) or
frozen (2 percent in the ice caps and glaciers). Most of the remainder (1
percent) is groundwater with minute proportions in freshwater lakes, soil
moisture, rivers and biological systems.<BR></TD>

<HR><P>Every day the hydrological cycle renews the world's freshwater
resources through evaporation and precipitation (see Box 8). The average annual
rainfall over land is 110 000 km<SUP>3</SUP>, but some 70 000 km<SUP>3</SUP>
evaporate before reaching the sea. The remaining 40 000 km<SUP>3</SUP> are
potentially available for human use. Global freshwater consumption is currently
around 4 000 km<SUP>3</SUP>, only 10 percent of the annual renewable
supply.<P>These numbers suggest that plenty of water is available for
human use but a closer look reveals a more complicated situation. The 40 000
km<SUP>3</SUP> of available water are distributed very unevenly and two-thirds
of it runs off in floods. That leaves around 14 000 km<SUP>3</SUP> as a
relatively stable supply. A substantial share of this supply should be left to
follow its natural course in order to safeguard wetlands, deltas, lakes and
rivers.<SUP>7</SUP> For example, 6 000 km<SUP>3</SUP> of water is needed to
dilute and transport the estimated 450 km<SUP>3</SUP> of waste water now
entering the world's rivers each year.<SUP>8</SUP> Without substantial
investment in waste water treatment and more effective regulation, even more
water will have to be diverted to dilute and transport wastes.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>7</SUP> S. Postel. 1992. <I>Last oasis:
facing water scarcity.</I> New York, Norton.<BR><SUP>8</SUP> See footnote 1.</BLOCKQUOTE>Precipitation, withdrawals and availability of water vary
widely around the world. Table 6 demonstrates regional changes in per caput
water availability since 1950 and shows forecasts for 2000. Per caput
availability is highest in Latin America and lowest in North Africa and the Near
East, while withdrawals are highest in North America and lowest in Africa. Per
caput water availability in Europe and North America is not expected to change
greatly by 2000, while Asians, Africans and Latin Americans will face less per
caput water availability as their populations continue to grow.<P>At present, Asia accounts for over one-half of the world's
water withdrawals. Figure 11 illustrates regional water consumption during the
past century. Forecasts to the year 2000 suggest that Asia will consume 60
percent of the world's water, followed by 15 percent in North America, 13
percent in Europe and less than 7 percent in Africa. Latin America's share of
world water consumption is forecast to be less than 5 percent in 2000, although
the region's consumption has nearly quadrupled since 1950.<P><H3><A NAME="b5-Water%20scarcity"></A> Water scarcity</H3><P>Human actions bring about water scarcity in three ways:
through population growth, misuse and inequitable access.<SUP>9</SUP> Population
growth contributes to scarcity simply because the available water supply must be
divided among more and more people. Every country has a more or less fixed
amount of internal water resources, defined as the average annual flow of rivers
and aquifers generated from precipitation. Overtime, this internal renewable
supply must be divided among more and more people, eventually resulting in water
scarcity.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>9</SUP> T.F. Homer-Dixon, J.H. Boutwell and

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Source:</I> N.B. Ayibotele. 1992. The
<I>world's water: assessing the resource.</I> Keynote paper at the ICWE, Dublin,
Ireland.</BLOCKQUOTE>When annual internal renewable water resources are less than 1
000 m<SUP>3 </SUP>per caput, water availability is considered a severe
constraint on socio-economic development and environmental protection. Table 7
lists the countries where per caput internal renewable water availability will
fall below 1 000 m<SUP>3</SUP> by the end of this decade. Most countries facing
chronic water scarcity problems are in North Africa, the Near East and
sub-Saharan Africa. Countries with less than 2 000 m<SUP>3</SUP> per caput face
a serious marginal water scarcity situation, with major problems occurring in
drought years. By the end of the 1990s, water availability is expected to fall
below 2 000 m<SUP>3</SUP> per caput in more than 40 countries.<P>In many countries, while scarcity is less of a problem at a
national level, serious water shortages are causing difficulties in specific
regions and watersheds. Notable examples include northern China, western and
southern India and parts of Mexico.<P>People also bring about water scarcity by polluting and
overusing existing supplies. Box 9 describes some of the pressing water
pollution issues. This type of scarcity can be regarded as the consumption of
the resource's "capital". For instance, an aquifer represents resource capital,
providing what is generally a renewable source of water "income" that can be
tapped for human consumption. Sustainable use of the aquifer leaves the capital
intact so that future generations can continuously use the renewable portion or
income. If pumping is greater than recharge, the aquifer is depleted and the
capital is consumed.<P>Overuse of groundwater has become a major problem in China,
India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Near East, North Africa, Thailand, the western
United States and many island countries where seawater intrusion
results.<P>The overpumping of aquifers not only results in a water source
that is too depleted to serve as a supply, it may also cause the land above the
aquifer to settle or subside, resulting in widespread structural damage in
extreme cases. Bangkok and Mexico City are well-known examples.<P>Finally, a shift in access or distribution patterns may
concentrate water resources among one group and subject others to extreme
scarcity. In many cities of the developing world, large numbers of people depend
on water vendors and may pay 100 times as much as the rate of public utilities
(see Table 8). Numerous recent studies document that large numbers of urban poor
pay much higher prices and a much larger share of their income for water than
families with access to a city water system.<SUP>10</SUP> Poor families in some
large cities spend up to 20 percent of their income on water. When the cost is
so high, they use little water for washing and bathing, which results in serious
health problems.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>10</SUP> See footnote 2.</BLOCKQUOTE><I>TABLE 7</I><P><B>Countries predicted to have scarce water resources</B> in

organized cooperative efforts to develop river valleys for irrigated
agriculture. Through irrigation technology, societies controlled and manipulated
natural water supplies to improve crop production. The result was often reliable
and ample food supplies which led to the creation of stable agricultural
villages, the division of labour and economic surpluses.<P>Many scholars still argue over whether irrigation technology
facilitated political control and development of the state or whether political
developments led to advancement of the technology. No matter the direction of
cause and effect, no one disputes the association of development with control
over water use.<P>In today's world, agriculture still accounts for the majority
of human water use. Globally, around 70 percent of water withdrawals are for
agriculture. Domestic and industrial uses consume the remaining 30
percent.<SUP>11</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>11</SUP> Domestic uses include drinking-water
supplies, private homes, commercial establishments, public services and
municipal supplies.</BLOCKQUOTE>Water uses differ greatly depending on access, quantity,
quality and socio-economic conditions. For example, Table 9 illustrates that
agricultural water use is higher as a proportion of total water use in the
low-income countries (91 percent) than in the high-income group (39
percent).<P><I>TABLE 9</I><P><B>Sectoral water withdrawals, by income group</B><P><TABLE BORDER>

Development Report </I>1992, based on WRI data.</BLOCKQUOTE>Nevertheless, on a per caput basis, the high-income countries
use more water for agricultural purposes than the low-income
countries.<P>The trends in world water use during this century are
presented in Figure 12. Overall, global water consumption has increased almost
tenfold. Agriculture's share, which was 90 percent in 1900, will have dropped to
an estimated 62 percent by 2000. During this same period, industrial consumption
will have grown from 6 percent to 25 percent, while consumption by cities will
have increased from 2 percent to nearly 9 percent. By 2000, around 35 percent of
available water supplies will be in use, compared with less than 5 percent at
the beginning of the century.<P>Water quantity and quality requirements also differ widely
depending on the type of use. Net agricultural requirements are especially large
in relation to other uses. For instance, around 15 000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of water
are normally sufficient to irrigate 1 ha of rice. This same amount of water can
supply: 100 nomads and 450 head of stock for three years; or 100 rural families
through house connections for four years; or 100 urban families for two years;
or 100 luxury hotel guests for 55 days.<SUP>12</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>12</SUP> I. Carruthers and C. dark. 1983.

<P><I>BOX 9</I><P><B>WATER AND POLLUTION</B><P>The quality of water from different sources varies widely.
Precipitation absorbs gases from the atmosphere and removes particles from the
air. When the precipitation strikes the ground it becomes surface water runoff
or enters the ground. The surface water flows into larger and larger channels,
ponds, lakes and rivers until some of it reaches the sea. Along its course,
surface water picks up both organic and mineral particles, bacteria and other
organisms as well as salts and other soluble substances. The water in lakes and
swamps sometimes acquires odours, tastes and colours from algae and other
organisms and from decaying vegetation.<P>Since ancient times, heavy metals from mining and pathogens
from cities have caused serious, although localized, contamination. Since the
industrial revolution, water pollution problems have become first regional, then
continental and now global in nature. Much water is polluted when it is used in
industry and agriculture or for domestic purposes. Mining is the major cause of
metal contamination, whereas other industries contribute to acidification. The
intensification of agricultural activities has led to the contamination of
groundwater by fertilizers and other chemicals. Moreover, irrigation projects
often cause a rapid rise in the level of groundwater, which leads to
waterlogging and soil salinity.<P>Since 1977, the UNEP/ WHO Global Environment Monitoring System
(GEMS) has been working with Unesco and WMO to develop a global water quality
monitoring network. More than 50 water variables are monitored to provide
information on the suitability of water for human consumption and for
agricultural, commercial and industrial use. Recent assessments have found that
the main water pollutants are: sewage, nutrients, toxic metals and industrial as
well as agricultural chemicals.<P>Conclusions drawn from the GEMS assessment include: the nature
and level of freshwater pollution strongly depends on socio-economic
development; the most common water pollutant is organic material from domestic
sewage, municipal waste and agro-industrial effluent; and the high water nitrate
levels found in Western Europe and the United States are a result of the
nitrogen fertilizers and manure used for intensive agriculture. The GEMS
assessment also noted a dramatic increase in the use of fertilizers in
developing countries, particularly where intensive irrigation allows for double
or triple cropping.<P>Other conditions highlighted in the GEMS report include
deforestation, eutrophication, suspended particulate matter (SM) and
salinity.<P>Deforestation, i.e. the clearing of land for agriculture and
urban development, often leads to water contamination. When the soil is stripped
of its protective vegetative covering, it becomes prone to erosion. This in turn
leads to higher water turbidity, because of the increased amounts of suspended
matter, to nutrient leaching and to a decreased water-retention capacity of the
soil. There is also concern about the destruction of wetlands, which destroys
the habitat of many species and removes natural filter mechanisms, permitting
many common pollutants to reach water supplies.<P>Eutrophication is the enrichment of waters with nutrients,
especially phosphorus and nitrogen. It can lead to enhanced plant growth and
depleted oxygen levels as this plant material decays. It is not always a
human-induced problem, but is often linked to organic waste and agricultural
runoff. Today 30 to 40 percent of the world's lakes and reservoirs are
eutrophic. Not all interventions have proved successful, but eutrophication can
be reversible if mid- and long-term strategies are enacted. Laws and measures
introduced to reduce tripolyphosphates (used mostly in detergents) and to remove
phosphorus from waste water have had positive effects.<P>SM consists of materials that float in suspension in water.
There are three main sources of SM: natural soil erosion, matter formed
organically within a water body and material produced as a by-product of human
activity. SM settles on the sediment bed and forms deposits in rivers, lakes,
deltas and estuaries. Evidence of human-induced SM from Roman and Mayan times
has been discovered in lake beds, implying that this was one of the first types
of water pollution. River damming affects the amount of SM flowing from rivers
to the oceans because reservoirs act as effective sinks for SM. An estimated 10
percent of the global SM discharge to the sea is trapped in reservoirs.
Approximately 25 percent of the water currently flowing to the oceans has been
previously stored in a reservoir. Damming can also greatly modify water quality;
waters flowing out of reservoirs not only have reduced SM quantities, they are
also depleted of nutrients and are often more saline, which consequently has
detrimental effects on downstream agriculture and fisheries.<P>Salinity is a significant and widespread form of freshwater
pollution, particularly in arid, semi-arid and some coastal regions. The primary
cause of salinization is a combination of poor drainage and high evaporation
rates which concentrate salts on irrigated land. Salinity can adversely affect
the productivity of irrigated crops and is also detrimental to industrial and
household water users. It is not a new phenomenon; salinization of soil and
water in the flood plain of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers contributed to the
decline of the Mesopotamian civilization some 6 000 years ago. The estimated
global gross area of irrigated land is 270 million ha. About 20 to 30 million ha
are severely affected by salinity while an additional 60 to 80 million ha are
affected to some degree. Waterlogged soil, which aggravates the problem of
salinity, is usually caused by overwatering and a lack of proper drainage
systems. Runoff from agricultural areas fertilized with manure and chemicals
pollutes watercourses and groundwater by increasing levels of
nutrients.<P>The present level of water pollution warrants that steps be
taken to control further contamination of water resources. More serious action
needs to be taken in water resource management, waste water treatment and the
provision of safe public water supplies. In developed and developing countries
there should be controls and regulations regarding the treatment and recycling
of industrial effluents, while efforts must be made to replace harmful products
and ban dangerous pesticides.<P>There is compelling evidence that at least 20 to 30 percent of
the water currently used in households and industries can be saved by adopting
appropriate regulatory and policy instruments (tariffs, quotas, groundwater
extraction charges). The twin benefits of clean water and reduced demand can be
obtained if the recycling or reuse of water is encouraged in industries through
pollution control legislation and economic incentives (water tariffs based on
economic costs, effluent charges and low-interest loans for effluent and sewage
treatment plants). Similar savings may be possible in irrigated agriculture by
investments in canal lining, by encouraging less water-intensive crops (through
relative output prices) and by raising irrigation rates.<BR></TD>

policy-makers are access and health. Nearly one billion people in the world are
without clean drinking-water. Providing easier access to safe drinking-water
significantly improves health conditions. Personal hygiene increases when water
availability rises above 50 litres per day (which generally means that it must
be delivered to the house or yard). An estimated 1.7 billion persons contend
with inadequate sanitation facilities. The lack of sewage collection and

estimates that providing access to safe water and adequate sanitation could
result in two million fewer deaths from diarrhoea among young children and 200
million fewer episodes of diarrhoeal illnesses each year.<P><H3><A NAME="b8-Water%20as%20a%20strategic%20resource"></A> Water as a strategic resource</H3><P>Water, even when plentiful, is frequently drawn into the realm
of politics. Domestic laws and well-established customs can help resolve
water-related disputes at national and village levels but international law has
not developed fast enough to deal with the growing number of water-related
conflicts between many countries and regions. In 1989, Egypt's then Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs, Boutros-Ghali, declared: "The national security of
Egypt is in the hands of the eight other African countries in the Nile
basin."<SUP>14</SUP> As Postel notes, Boutros-Ghali highlights the importance of
water to Egypt's economy as well as the advantage upstream countries have over
downstream neighbours.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>14</SUP> See footnote 7.</BLOCKQUOTE>The increasing value of water, concern about water quality and
quantity, and problems of access and denial have given rise to the concept of
resource geopolitics or "hydropolitics". In this context, water joins petroleum
and certain minerals as a strategic resource. Its increasing scarcity and value
will only intensify the prevalence of water politics and relevant international
conflicts.<P>Several countries depend heavily on river flows from other
countries. Botswana, Bulgaria, Cambodia, the Congo, Egypt, the Gambia, Hungary,
Luxembourg, Mauritania, the Netherlands, Romania, the Sudan and the Syrian Arab
Republic all receive over 75 percent of their available water supplies from the
river flows of upstream neighbours. More than 40 percent of the world's
population lives in river basins that are shared by more than one
country.<P>Along with land and energy sources, water has been the focus
of disputes and, in extreme cases, even wars. The division of the Indus waters
and its tributaries among India and Pakistan provided a salutary warning
example. War was only just avoided in the early years of independence by a
binding agreement, backed by massive international aid, to build two huge water
storage dams and a system of canals. Water could then be channelled to the areas
of Pakistan that were deprived of water when some of the Indus tributaries were
diverted into Indian territory.<P>The costs to all parties of this settlement were high but
certainly less than the human and financial costs of a conflict. Many other
international rivers, including the Nile, Euphrates, Ganges and Mekong, are
prospective risk points for disputes. The future of the Jordan waters is already
an integral component of regional peace talks and illustrates how complicated
hydropolitics can be. The fact that groundwater resources are also involved in
the talks adds another dimension of difficulty.<P><TABLE BORDER>

across catchment areas or groundwater aquifers; second, water development and
management should be based on a participatory approach that involves users,
planners and policy-makers at all levels; third, women play a central part in
the provision, management and safeguarding of water; and, finally, water has an
economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic
good.<BR><p></TD>

at risk, unless water and land resources are managed more effectively in the
future.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>15</SUP> <I>The Dublin Statement and Report
of the Conference.</I> 1992. ICWE, Dublin, Ireland.</BLOCKQUOTE>To address water problems at local, national and international
levels, the ICWE recommended a range of development strategies and policies
based on four principles (see Box 10). While the conference participants readily
agreed on the wording of the first three principles, the fourth provoked a long
and contentious debate. Principle 4 declares that water has an economic value in
all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good.<P>For many, it is difficult to reconcile the concept of water as
an economic good with the traditional idea of water as a basic necessity and
human right. Older elementary economic textbooks explain this conceptual puzzle
- why diamonds, which have so little utility, are expensive while freshwater,
which is so essential to life, is cheap. More recent texts leave water out of
these vignettes. Like fresh air, water was once considered a classic free good;
now that it is growing scarce, while not yet expensive, it is at least
acknowledged to be valuable.<P>Scarcity is one of the most important issues in considering
the various socio-economic tradeoffs in allocating water among different users.
Allocation policies and decisions determine who will have access to water and
under what conditions, and what impact this will have on society and the
economy.<P>The cheapness of water is often more apparent than real. It is
a free good not because water provision is without cost - obviously this is far
from true - but because governments have chosen to charge less than full costs
for water services for one or more reasons.<SUP>16 </SUP>These subsidies are now
coming under scrutiny. The ICWE's final report acknowledges that failure in the
past to recognize water's economic value and the real cost of service provision
has led to wasteful and environmentally damaging uses. Moreover, the conference
report states that managing water as an economic good is an important way of
achieving efficient and equitable use, as well as encouraging the conservation
and protection of scarce water resources.<BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>16</SUP> Water may be considered a "free"
good in the form of rain, but when this free good is captured and delivered to
customers by canal, pipe or other means, it becomes a water service. There is
generally much less resistance to water service fees than there is to water
charges.</BLOCKQUOTE>It is in this context that the ICWE and UNCED called for a new
approach to the assessment, development and management of freshwater resources.
The proposed approach involves the management of freshwater as a finite and
vulnerable resource and the integration of sectoral water plans and programmes
within the framework of national economic and social
policy.<SUP>17</SUP><BLOCKQUOTE><SUP>17</SUP> UN. 1992. Protection of the quality

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><I>BOX 11</I><BR><B>FRAGMENTED PLANNING AND WATER RESOURCES IN SOUTHERN
INDIA</B><P>The World Bank's water resources management policy paper
presents several examples from southern India to illustrate the kinds of problem
caused by fragmented decision-making. The Chittur River's highly variable flows
have traditionally been diverted at many points into small reservoirs to
irrigate the main rice crop. The diversion channels are large enough to
accommodate flood flows following the monsoon rains. Thus, when a storage dam
was constructed, the uppermost channel was able to absorb virtually all the
regulated flow. The upper tanks now tend to remain full throughout the year,
concentrating benefits and adding to evaporation losses. The more extensive
lower areas have reverted to uncertain rain-fed cultivation, and total
agricultural value added has decreased. Construction of the storage dam without
adequate consideration of downstream users or the existing storage capacity of
the basin is one example of how individual project development in isolation can
cause significant economic losses.<P>The construction of the Sathanur Dam on the Ponnani River in
Tamil Nadu to serve a left bank command area deprived productive delta areas of
irrigation water. While the rights of downstream irrigators are recognized in
the dam operating rules, most of the regulated flow is diverted upstream; water
losses have greatly increased in the wide sandy bed and no surface water has
reached the sea for 20 or more years. Continued spills in about 50 percent of
all years were used to justify the subsequent construction of the right bank
command, further aggravating shortages in the delta and leading to continual
conflicts between the two Sathanur commands. Meanwhile, additional storage dams
on upstream tributaries are adding to evaporation losses in what was already a
fully developed basin. Irrigation in the productive delta has declined further
and the Sathanur commands in turn are suffering. The high-value crops that were
once grown on the main river are being replaced by cultivation on less
productive lands, served by tributaries that are more variable than the main
river.<P>The Amaravati River, a tributary of the Cauvery, is the most
disputed major river in India. In the absence of a Cauvery agreement, Karnataka
(the upstream riparian state) has steadily developed large irrigation schemes,
depriving the delta (Tamil Nadu's rice bowl) of its accustomed supplies.
Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has been developing the Amaravati. As at Sathanur, water
releases are made from the Amaravati Dam for the traditional areas, but these
are far downstream and the substitution of regulated flood flows has encouraged
the development of private pumps along the river bank. Even though the new
electric connections have now been banned, little can be done to control illegal
connections or diesel pumps and, consequently, little water now reaches the
lowest commands, let alone the Cauvery. Meanwhile, new storage dams are being
constructed on tributaries both in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, further depriving not
only the old lands but also the new lands and the pump areas.<BR></TD>

downstream countries for years afterwards, thereby affecting hydroelectric and
irrigation capacity. When a city overpumps a groundwater supply, streamflows may
be reduced in surrounding areas; when it contaminates its surface water, it can
pollute groundwater supplies as well. Certain human actions at local levels may
contribute to climate change, with long-term implications for the hydrological
system worldwide.<P>Water policies, laws, projects, regulations and administrative
actions often overlook these linkages. Governments generally tend to organize
and administer water sector activities separately: one department is in charge
of irrigation; another oversees water supply and sanitation; a third manages
hydropower activities; a fourth supervises transportation; a fifth controls
water quality; a sixth directs environmental policy; and so forth.<P>These fragmented bureaucracies make uncoordinated decisions,
reflecting individual agency responsibilities that are independent of each
other. Too often, government planners develop the same water source within an
interdependent system for different and competing uses (see Box 11). This
project-by-project, department-by-department and region-by-region approach is no
longer adequate for addressing water issues.<P>To help resolve the growing number of water resource issues,
policy-makers are increasingly being called on to review and explain the
conditions, problems and progress in the overall water sector.<P>This integrated approach requires water managers to understand
not only the water cycle (including rainfall, distribution, ecosystem
interactions and natural environment and land-use changes), but also the diverse
intersectoral development needs for water resources.<P>The next section further explores this important concept of
linking the water sector with the national economy and provides a conceptual
basis for understanding the role of economic policy-making.<P><p><hr>
